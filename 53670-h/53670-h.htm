<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">To those accustomed only to the comforts of
civilized life, or to the traveller who is indifferent to the beauties
of scenery, the monotony, silence, and loneliness of the vast forests
of Assam, will present few features of attraction; but as the country
offers a wide field of discovery, and so many interesting enquiries
remain to be prosecuted in regard to the numerous wild tribes by which
it is inhabited, it is hoped that the present brief outline of the
condition of the people will not prove altogether uninteresting.</p>
<p class="par">The chief object of the following pages is to make Assam
better known, to remove some prejudices which exist against it, and
preserve the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd24e187" href="#xd24e187"
name="xd24e187">vi</a>]</span>memory of many remarkable scenes. The
narrative of the principal events has been compiled from official
documents, with the knowledge of Government; but the Author has
expressed his own unbiassed opinions on many interesting subjects with
which he became acquainted during a residence of some years in the
Province. Much more might have been described, but the few
authenticated facts now put forth will probably suffice, from their
novelty and interest, to amuse the reader until greater leisure and
further experience enable the Author to present a more comprehensive
work.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In November, 1840, being then on duty at Mynpooree
in Upper India, with my regiment, in which I filled the office of
Interpreter and Quarter-Master, I had the honour of receiving from the
Governor-General of India the appointment of second in command to the
Assam Light Infantry. Regimental duty amongst our earliest military
companions has its charms, but there is not an officer in the East
India Company&rsquo;s service, be his attachment to his comrades and
the sepoys under him ever so strong, who does not hail with joy the day
that gives him comparative <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb2" href=
"#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span>freedom, especially when that freedom is
accompanied by the proud emotions ever attendant upon the possession of
higher command. Accordingly I was much elated at the distinction that
had been conferred on me; nor were my pleasurable sensations diminished
by the circumstance of the future scenes of my service lying in a
country that I had already once visited, and regarding which I felt an
uncommon degree of interest. Bidding my friends farewell, therefore, I
quitted Mynpooree, marched to Futtyghur, and thence embarking in a
native boat upon the Ganges, proceeded to Dacca by the ordinary route,
reaching the station in the latter end of December 1840. At Dacca,
engaging new and more commodious boats, I again set out on my journey
to Assam, and entered the Burrampooter river near the military station
of Jumalpore, and arrived at Goalparah, the entrance to Assam, in
nineteen days.</p>
<p class="par">The military station of Goalparah is situated on the
left bank of the Burrampooter, on the summit of an oblong hill three
hundred feet high, commanding one of the most magnificent views of the
Bootan and Himalaya Mountains, partially covered with snow, that can
well be imagined. There are (or were at the time of which I write)
three bungalows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>(ground floor cottages) on the small space of table
land on the hill, occupied by the officers attached to the district.
From its elevation, many are disposed to claim for the hill the
enviable title of &ldquo;the Sanitarium of Assam,&rdquo; but however
just its pretension to salubrity may be, the same degree of credit
cannot be extended beyond this isolated spot. Many parts of the
division are so inimical to life, that the mortality both of Europeans
and natives, equals, if it does not exceed, that in any district in
Assam. The noxious exhalations from the Garrow hills and woods seem
more deadly than the climate of the Northern Dooars, of which few
persons resident there can long resist the depressing effects. Unless
endowed with great stamina, life is here frequently extinguished by
jungle fever in the course of a few days.</p>
<p class="par">The town of Goalparah, consisting of about seven
thousand inhabitants, is built wholly of mats, grass, bamboos, and
reeds, at the foot of the hills, and as the adjoining country is a low,
swampy level, interspersed with slight elevations, it is subject to
annual inundations. The chief traders are Kyahs, merchants from the
western parts of India; and at no place in Assam is there a more
extensive and lucrative trade carried on in cloths of English and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb4" href="#pb4" name=
"pb4">4</a>]</span>Indian manufacture; rice, mustard-seed, cotton from
the Garrow hills, manjeet, and other articles.</p>
<p class="par">A three months&rsquo; residence at the station of
Goalparah in 1837, rendered a prolonged stay unnecessary on the present
visit. An absence of three years had produced few changes in the
condition of the people or the appearance of the buildings, excepting
in the house I formerly occupied, which had been suffered to become a
heap of ruins. One vestige of the <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, however,
gratified my self-love. A little glass window-frame, made with my own
hands, still survived the destruction of time and the elements, and
vividly recalled to memory the difficulty I had overcome in
endeavouring to admit light into my little dwelling. Such a luxury as
window glass being unknown at the remote station, I had purchased some
of the small looking-glasses which always abound in the Indian bazaars,
and, removing the quicksilver, converted them into window panes.</p>
<p class="par">Leaving Goalparah, six days were occupied in reaching
Gowahatty by water. In Gowahatty, the metropolis of Assam, I perceived
a vast change; many buildings of brick had been erected and the
foundation of a church laid; numerous native shops evinced increasing
prosperity, and much had been accomplished towards rendering the
station more <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span>salubrious by the removal of jungle and the
construction of many beautiful roads. The best and largest bungalows at
Gowahatty are all on the banks of the Burrampooter, and the view of the
river, the islands, temples, and verdant foliage of the trees forms
perhaps one of the most picturesque scenes to be met with in India.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd24e620width" id="p005"><img src="images/p005.jpg"
alt="GOWAHATTY." width="720" height="473">
<p class="figureHead">GOWAHATTY.</p>
<p class="par first"><i>London, Smith Elder &amp; C<sup>o</sup>. 65,
Cornhill</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The native town of Gowahatty is built entirely of
bamboos, reeds, and grass. To the south an extensive marsh almost
surrounds the whole station, and the contiguity of many old tanks,
choked with jungle, coupled with the vicinity of the hills on every
quarter except the north, renders this town, in spite of the
improvements already alluded to, one of the most insalubrious in Assam.
In the cold season, from the 1st of November to the 1st of February,
the fogs at Gowahatty are extremely dense and heavy, and last
frequently until ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock in the day; but it is
generally admitted that this state of the atmosphere is by no means
unfavourable to health. The rainy months of June, July, August, and
September, are here always trying to Europeans, as the moist heat has a
much more depressing influence than the rains of the Western Provinces
of India.</p>
<p class="par">Nearly two months having been passed in boats
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name=
"pb6">6</a>]</span>on the river, from Futtyghur to Gowahatty, I became
anxious to reach the end of my journey by a more expeditious mode than
that of tracking up against the stream a few miles every day. I
accordingly quitted my budgerow and embarked in a canoe formed of a
single tree hollowed out. It was forty-eight feet long, and three feet
wide, ten feet of the length being covered in with a small mat roof, as
an apology for a cabin. In this I felt by no means uncomfortable,
though I had only a little more room than served to enable me to lie
down at full length.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

<p class="par first"><i>London, Smith Elder &amp; C<sup>o</sup>. 65,

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The solitariness of my position, only enlivened by the
song of eighteen merry paddlers, pulling from morning till night, at
the rate of forty or fifty miles a day, against a rapid stream, was
perhaps the worst part of the story. The scenery, if not positively
devoid of picturesque beauty, wearied me from its monotonous character.
Sand-banks, woods, and hills, unvaried by the residence of man, or the
slightest token of civilization, constituted its leading features.
Occasionally a boat might be encountered, but, excepting from the rude
salutation of the wild crew, the screaming of wild fowl, and the loud
crash of falling banks, prostrating lofty trees in the bosom of the
river, not a sound was heard to relieve the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name="pb7">7</a>]</span>pervading
solitude. But, altogether, the velocity of the trip, with the
<i>d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ment</i> of limited accommodation, was a good
exchange for the comforts of a budgerow, and the tediousness of its
pace.</p>
<p class="par">Passing the healthy and pretty stations of Tezpore and
Bishnath, I arrived at the mouth of the little stream Dikhoo, in nine
days, and, mounting an elephant, rode through a dense tree and grass
jungle to Seebsaugur, distant twelve miles from the Burrampooter. It
was a bitterly raw, cold, wet day; but a blazing fire on the floor in
the snug reed and grass cottage of an acquaintance, soon erased from my
memory the inconvenience of the previous ten days&rsquo; exposure.</p>
<p class="par">In the rains, the Burrampooter river resembles a sea,
extending for many miles over the country. In the dry season it will be
found in many places more than a mile wide. The current in Upper Assam,
above Dibroo Ghur, is much more rapid than the Ganges river, and far
more dangerous; from the river being strewed with immense trees, which
are whirled down the stream with awful impetuosity, threatening instant
destruction to the boat so unfortunate as to come in contact with them.
For this reason, the canoes of the country being more manageable, and
even if filled with water, too <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>buoyant to sink, much less risk is
incurred by travelling in them than in the comfortable budgerow, or
large native boat of Western India, roofed with straw. The canoe has
also another advantage, in case of a storm, as it can in a few minutes
be dragged on shore and remain in perfect safety till the <i>toofan</i>
has passed over. The confinement, however, and constant reclining
posture are almost unbearable in the hot weather; and there is a
painful sense of insecurity from the streams and rivers in many parts
of Assam swarming with crocodiles. Natives, when bathing, are not
unfrequently seized by crocodiles, and I have heard that one of these
amphibious monsters has been known to seize a paddler unsuspiciously
sleeping in the front part of the boat: which is not improbable, as the
sides of a canoe are only six inches or a foot above the water. Such
occurrences, however, are too rare to justify the fears that are
entertained; but their rarity, considering the great numbers of
crocodiles on the banks, is nevertheless a marvel. In the Chawlkhawa
river, opposite Burpetah, I have seen basking in the sun on the sand
banks, as many as ten crocodiles at a time; and upon one occasion, a
heap of one hundred crocodile&rsquo;s eggs, each about the size of a
turkey&rsquo;s egg, were discovered on a sand bank, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>brought to
me; I found on blowing them, that they all contained a perfectly formed
crocodile, about two inches long, which would have crept forth after a
few days&rsquo; farther exposure to the sun.</p>
<p class="par">The flesh of the crocodile is like that of fish,
emitting the same odour, and partaking of the flavour of the coarsest
of the finny tribe. After skinning a small crocodile caught by a
fisherman in his net, one of my native servants made a curry of the
flesh, which is consumed by some low caste men in Assam, as well as in
Western India. The eggs of crocodiles and river turtle are esteemed
delicacies. Upon the merits of the flesh of the turtle I need not
expatiate. I have frequently endeavoured to shoot the crocodile, but if
they be not almost invulnerable, they contrive to elude capture; for
when wounded they manage to get into the river, and either escape to
recover, or die out of sight. It never was my fortune to kill and
secure more than one, which was upwards of twelve feet in length. He
was mortally stricken with one ball.</p>
<p class="par">The station of Seebsaugur merits little notice. It is a
low, flat country, subject to inundations. There are several large
artificial tanks, and one or two fine old Hindoo temples, in and about
the station. The fort of Rungpore, built of brick on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>the
opposite side of the Dikhoo stream, is quite in ruins; and of the old
city of Rungpore, not a hut is now in existence: all the inhabitants
being now apparently located at Seebsaugur, which, from having become
the residence of the civil officers in charge of the district, will in
a few years, in all probability, be a populous, thriving town. After a
few days&rsquo; residence at Seebsaugur, I again set out in a small
boat on the Burrampooter; passing the new station of Dibroo Ghur, the
residence of the Political Agent of Upper Assam, and other gentlemen
connected with the manufacture of tea, I ascended the dangerous rapid
formed by a ridge of stones extending almost across the river, a little
below the junction of the two rivers, Dihong and Dibong, with the
Burrampooter, and in seven days from Seebsaugur, arrived at the end of
my journey, Saikwah. Here I assumed the command of three hundred men,
and two six-pounders.</p>
<p class="par">The site of Saikwah, the north-eastern frontier military
post in Upper Assam, is on the south bank of the Burrampooter; on low
ground, intersected by numerous streams and surrounded with dense high
tree-jungle, having the Bisnacorie and the Saikwah streams on the west
and east, and the Burrampooter on the north. For the comfort of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>the troops, a space of about one thousand square
yards has been cleared of jungle. In the vicinity of, or a few miles
distant from Saikwah, there are some small villages inhabited by tribes
denominated Dooaneahs, Moolooks, Kesungs, Jillys, Mishmees, and Meerees
who, from their wild habits, prefer the jungles to the plains. They
grow a scanty supply of rice, kullie (a species of vetch) and Indian
corn; the whole of which is generally consumed in a few months, leaving
them to depend for the remainder of the year on leaves of the forest
kutchoos (a kind of arrow-root) and wild yams. Saikwah was selected as
a military post in 1839, immediately after the station of Suddeah on
the opposite or north bank had been surprised and burnt by the
neighbouring tribes. It is eighty miles distant from the Patkoe
mountains, separating Assam from Burmah; but it is by no means so
desirable a station for the health of the troops as the deserted post
of Suddeah, in an open plain of six miles in extent. The object,
however, of the change of locality, was to enable the Light Infantry to
afford protection to the tea-gardens in Muttuck from the sudden
aggressions of the numerous wild, fierce, border tribes. In this
respect it has answered; hitherto, few depredations having been
committed, though insurrections have been frequent. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The trade of Saikwah consists of ivory, wax, and a
little cotton; the amount of ivory sold in the bazaar, the shopkeepers
informed me, averaged annually about six hundred pounds. A more
desolate place than Saikwah can scarcely be imagined. It is surrounded
by fierce and treacherous tribes, who occupy a most impenetrable tree
and grass jungle, and whose endeavours are perpetually directed to the
annihilation of the troops. At first, the hourly patrol&rsquo;s grand
rounds and alarms allowed me little rest or ease, but the alertness of
the troops in getting under arms at night to repel any meditated
attack, soon obliterated from my mind all apprehension of surprise. The
Assam Light Infantry wish for nothing better than an opportunity of
contending with the Singphoos, or indeed with any of their treacherous
neighbours (whom they hold in the utmost contempt) in a fair battle in
the open country; but in the jungles they find it almost impossible to
come in contact with their foes.</p>
<p class="par">A few days after my arrival at Saikwah sufficed to
plaster my mat-and-grass cottage with mud, and with the assistance of
the Sipahees, a chimney for a fire-place was soon constructed, with
bricks and mortar obtained from old buildings at Suddeah; then putting
in a glass window, I was enabled, in comfort <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>and
solitariness, to pursue my usual vocations in all weathers. In this
secluded retreat, every incident, however trifling in itself, acquired
an importance which induced me to note it in my tablets. On one
occasion, about eight o&rsquo;clock at night, sitting by a snug
fireside, my attention was arrested by the approach of an unwelcome
visitor making his way in at the door. Taking up a candle to ascertain
who or what was forcing ingress to my dwelling, I beheld a python, or
boa-constrictor, about six feet long, steadily advancing towards me. In
my defenceless position it may be imagined that safety depended on
immediate flight; and the monster thus speedily gained entire
possession of my habitation. It was, however, for a few minutes only,
that he was permitted to remain the undisturbed occupant of the abode;
for my servants quickly despatched the intruder with a few blows
inflicted with long poles. An apothecary, who had long been attached to
the Assam Light Infantry, assured me that pythons, or boa-constrictors,
were very numerous in our vicinity, and of an immense size, some not
being less than fifteen or eighteen feet in length. I had evidence of
the truth of the statement; a skin, fifteen feet long, being
subsequently brought me by the natives. I caused it to be tanned
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>and sent to England. Small serpents were often met
with. On one occasion the apothecary brought me two boa-constrictors of
about four feet long, which he had found on a table curled up amongst
some bottles in the same room where his children were sleeping. In all
probability the lives of the infants were saved by the musquitto
curtains preventing access to the bed. Boa-constrictors are exceedingly
fond of rats, and on this occasion they had evidently been in search of
their prey.</p>

<p class="par">As my cottage had not the usual white cloth ceiling
suspended, insects, snakes, and vermin frequently descended from the
roof into the rooms; but by keeping the house free of baggage and well
swept, contact with them was avoided. The reader will suppose an Assam
mat-hut to be a dreary kind of residence; but I can assure him, the
logwood fire on a hearth one foot high, in the centre of the room, with
a small window cut high in the wall for the escape of the smoke, is by
no means devoid of cheerfulness.</p>
<div class="par">The general characteristic of the climate of Upper
Assam is excessive moisture. Rains fall heavily and frequently in
March, April, and May, and continue to the middle of October; and from
this time till February the atmosphere is cool and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=

the north and south, are peopled by a variety of tribes differing from
one another in aspect, language, and customs, I have, in later pages,
briefly depicted each class; mingling personal description with a
narrative of as much of their respective histories as circumstances
have put it in my power to offer.

district of Kamroop, and for the promotion of trade, the
Governor-General&rsquo;s Agent directed the establishment of an
out-post for an assistant at Burpetah, on the Chawl Khawa river, and I
was selected to proceed for eight months upon this duty.</p>
<p class="par">The population of Burpetah is estimated at about three
thousand souls; their huts are built without any regularity on high
artificial mounds of earth, in the centre of gardens of betel nut and
plantain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>trees, clumps of bamboos, cane and grass jungle,
mango and other large trees, under the shade of which, impervious to
the sun, roads or channels intersect the town in every direction. In
the rainy season, these channels, owing to the inundation of the
country, are filled with water many feet in depth. Every house,
consequently, is provided with one or more canoes, in which the
inhabitants visit each other&rsquo;s isolated positions; and the cattle
are brought upon the little eminences at night, and housed oftentimes
under the same roof with the family, if not in the same room. Daily may
the cattle be seen swimming across these street-streams in search of a
dry spot of land on which to graze. In this manner, for four months of
each year&mdash;June, July, August, and September&mdash;are the people
surrounded by floods; but, as if endowed with amphibious natures, they
seem equally happy in or out of the water, and pass their time on board
their boats in trading with other villages throughout Assam. When at
home, they amuse themselves during the rainy season in collecting the
wood which floats down the rivers, from the destruction of their banks
alluded to in the foregoing chapter; and in the sport of catching wild
buffaloes, deer, and pigs, which are now seen in great numbers swimming
across the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=

more elevated spots on which to subsist: the animals in their passage,

<p class="par">At Burpetah there is a very long building supported by
wooden posts carved with emblems of Hindoo Deities, with a grass roof
and mat walls. It is called a shuster, alias temple; and is a religious
endowment, where the vedas or holy books of the Hindoos are chanted,
and offerings in kind and cash received. A grant of rent-free land,
given by the Assam king Sebsunker, in 1657 <span class="sc">A.S.</span>
or 1735 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> is attached to the temple, and a
number of disciples, with two chief priests or pontiffs, manage the
affairs of the establishment.</p>
<p class="par">On the trees at Burpetah, great numbers of the Vampire
or Fox-bats are to be seen hanging by their claws with their heads
downwards. They are offensive looking objects, having a body eleven
inches long, and each wing twenty-two inches in length. I have never
heard a native assert that they suck the blood of cattle when sleeping,
and if it were the case, such a circumstance would certainly be quickly
verified; it may therefore justly be inferred, that this is a popular
error. It is said that the food of the fox-bat consists entirely of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>jungle fruits; their flesh is esteemed a delicacy
by many natives, and I have frequently shot them to gratify the
appetites of my own servants. There is a strange superstition amongst
the natives, that the bones of the fox-bat, worn as an amulet or charm,
will cure any limb or part of the body affected with pain.</p>
<p class="par">One of the most curious members of the animal (query,
vegetable?) world in Assam is the Leaf insect&mdash;so called from its
very close resemblance in form, colour, and general structure (even to
the fibre), to the leaf of the tree which it inhabits. In fact, until
the insect moves, it is difficult to distinguish it from the leaf
itself. The annexed drawing will convey an idea of this singular freak
of nature; many attempts at transmitting a perfect specimen to Europe
have been frustrated by the perishable character of the insect. Spirits
are entirely inefficacious as preservatives, and camphor destroys the
colour of the animal.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In perambulating the district, I was particularly struck
with the immense extent of high grass jungle between the Burrampooter
river and the foot of the Bootan mountains. I frequently traversed a
distance of eight and ten miles through a dense grass jungle twenty
feet high, without meeting with a solitary hut or any cultivation; but
suddenly, a village <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>and an open cultivated space of a few hundred
acres would burst upon the view and vary the monotony of the scene.
This would be followed by a dreary waste extending to the next village,
often five or six miles distant; while a solitary foot-path, forming
the only communication between the small communities thus isolated,
clearly showed that for many months in the year little intercourse,
except by water, is kept up between them.</p>
<p class="par">The country is infested with wild animals, and the
footpaths are dangerous at all times. Some slight idea may be formed of
the danger to human life from the denizens of the jungle, when I state
that in the western quarter of the district of Kamroop alone, in the
short period of six months, the police reports included twenty men
killed by wild elephants and buffaloes. The damage done to the rice
crops yearly by wild elephants and buffaloes is very considerable; and
although Government bestows a reward of two rupees eight annas, or five
shillings, for every buffalo destroyed, and five rupees or ten
shillings for every tiger&rsquo;s head, such is the apathy and
indifference of the natives to their own interests and preservation,
that they seldom exert themselves to earn the gratuity, until repeated
aggressions become unbearable. When wild elephants pull down
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>their huts, or a tiger, from previous success,
becomes emboldened to enter their little dwellings and carry off their
cattle, then the village community will turn out in a body; surrounding
with nets the tiger&rsquo;s lair,&mdash;a small patch of jungle in the
vicinity of the village,&mdash;and shouting and yelling, they drive the
intruder into the nets, where he falls an easy victim to the spears and
bludgeons of the enraged and injured populace.</p>
<p class="par">In January, February, March, and April, the whole
country adjoining Burpetah presents a spectacle seldom seen elsewhere:
the natives set fire to the jungle to clear the land for cultivation,
and to open the thoroughfares between the different villages, and the
awful roar and rapidity with which the flames spread cannot be
conceived. A space of many miles of grass jungle, twenty feet high, is
cleared in a few hours; and the black ashes scattered over the face of
the earth after such recent verdure, form one of the most gloomy and
desolate landscapes that can well be imagined. But so rapid is
vegetation in Assam, that a few days suffice to alter the scene: the
jungle speedily shoots up with greater strength than ever, and at the
approach of the heavy rains in June, it again attains a height of many
feet. On more occasions than one, though mounted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>on an
elephant, I have had the greatest difficulty to out-flank a fierce
roaring fire, rapidly moving with the wind, in a long line over the
country. The elephant, of all animals, is the most fearful of fire; and
on hearing the approach of the element he instantly takes to flight;
but the rapidity with which the flames spread renders escape most
hazardous, especially if the wind is high and <i>right aft</i>. The
best plan to adopt if a fire breaks out to windward, is to circle round
the nearest flank with all expedition, gaining the space burnt by the
advancing flames. On foot, escape would be almost impossible; the
jungle being impenetrable except by a narrow footpath, and this being
frequently overgrown with grass, if no open spot be near at hand,
inevitable destruction must be the fate of any unfortunate traveller to
leeward of a fire.</p>
<p class="par">In Assam, excepting the fields close to the villages,
the best land is never manured. One crop of planted winter
<i>d&rsquo;han</i> or rice is cut in November or December, every year,
from generation to generation. This land is never allowed to lie
fallow; abundant rain being all that is requisite to ensure plentiful
crops: the richness of the soil seems inexhaustible.</p>
<p class="par">The low lands liable to inundation are never manured;
the jungle is burnt down, and for three <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>successive years two
crops are annually realized from it. In February, mustard seed is
gathered in: a source of great profit to the cultivator; and in June
the spring rice, sown broad-cast, is reaped. After the land has been
thus impoverished, it is allowed to remain fallow for three years; and
fresh jungle land is burnt and prepared in the same primitive way, and
with the most simple implements of husbandry. In other parts of Assam
extensive tracts of land are beautifully cultivated, and pretty
villages are numerously studded over the country; but, although lakes
and streams are everywhere to be met with, no attempt is made by the
Assamese tribes, excepting the Cacharries, to irrigate the land, and
thus render the crops more certain and productive.</p>
<p class="par">The Cacharries who reside at the foot of the hills are
the most useful and industrious, as well as the most athletic men in
Assam, and allowed to be the best cultivators. They irrigate their
lands to a great extent from hill streams, and consequently raise far
better crops than their neighbours. During the months of June, July,
August, and September, a great portion of Assam is inundated, and boats
leaving the innumerable streams and large rivers, paddle over the
country in every direction; indeed, in many places, particularly at
Burpetah, boats form <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24"
name="pb24">24</a>]</span>the only means by which any communication can
be kept up. To facilitate intercourse during the dry season, roads have
been constructed, and bullock-carts introduced, similar to the hackerys
in use in the Western Provinces of India, for the conveyance of the
produce of the lands to the best markets; but the Assamese are so
wedded to their old customs, and attached to the use of slaves and
bondsmen in every capacity&mdash;as servants, porters, and cultivators,
that it has been found no easy matter to induce them to adopt a new
system, however obvious its advantages.</p>
<p class="par">A new era, however, is approaching: a law has been
promulgated, abolishing slavery in India, and as the people become more
enlightened by education and intercourse with Europeans, they will
relax their adherence to old and absurd usages and prejudices. In the
district of Kamroop above twenty thousand slaves and bondsmen may
obtain manumission by simply asking for it; and as there is no doubt
they will do so, we may anticipate, from the acquisition of freedom, a
total alteration of the habits and feelings of the Assamese. Large
wastes of land will be brought under cultivation, and thousands of
families made independent and comfortable. Assam has now been subjected
to British rule for a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>period of nearly twenty years, and the people
have enjoyed the fruits of their labours in peace and security: a
condition of things to which they were strangers under their own
chieftains.</p>
<p class="par">The population of Assam is assumed to be about 800,000
souls; but as no correct census has been taken, the accuracy of the
estimate cannot be determined. It may be presumed, however, that the
population does not increase to any great extent, for a state of
slavery and bondage has never been favourable to the due multiplication
of the human species.</p>
<p class="par">The proprietors of slaves and bondsmen consist of the
most respectable men in Assam, and of course are strenuous supporters
of the continuation of the lucrative and nefarious traffic in their
fellow-creatures. To deprive them of their proprietary right to their
slaves it has been urged would be unjust, and offensive to their
usages; and, following the example of the West India proprietors, they
contend that the slaves being their lawful property as much as houses,
grain, or cattle, compensation should be made by Government for the
release of every man from bondage. The Indian Government, however, has
adopted a different course. It has published a regulation that forbids
the officers of all courts from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>allowing forcible possession of
the person or services of a slave, or his property. In future,
therefore, slave-holders will not be able to compel their slaves to
obey their orders, and as this law becomes gradually enforced, slavery
will be practically abolished; a new order of men will arise,
stimulated to more vigorous exertions by the conviction that they will
reap the benefit of their labours, and extended cultivation and a freer
exchange of commodities will infallibly ensue.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The enormous extent of forest, and high, dense
grass jungle in Assam, exceeds perhaps that of any other country of the
same area; and, as a consequence, the herds of wild elephants,
buffaloes, deer, rhinosceroses, and tigers, are innumerable. Almost
every military officer in civil employ in Assam, having constantly to
roam about the country, becomes, if not from choice, at least in
self-defence, a keen and skilful sportsman. Herds of one hundred
buffaloes each are frequently met with; and though I have known twenty
buffaloes shot in one day&rsquo;s diversion, they are so prolific, and
the season of four months for sport is so short, that no actual
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>progress appears to be made in the diminution of
their numbers. On some occasions, when a buffalo is wounded and unable
to escape into high jungle, he furiously charges the elephant on which
the sportsman is mounted in a howdah, and often gores the elephant, or
injures the feet or legs of the driver seated on the animal&rsquo;s
neck, before he can be stopped in his career; for it frequently takes
ten or twelve balls to destroy a buffalo, unless an early shot inflicts
a vital wound. The elephant, if well trained, on being charged by a
buffalo, merely turns round and presents his stern to the repeated
blows of the infuriated monster: screaming out, however, in the utmost
fright until the buffalo is shot or scared off by the firing; but a
timid or badly trained elephant, on being charged instantly seeks
safety in flight, to the imminent peril of the sportsman, should any
trees happen to come in contact with the howdah. Buffaloes, however,
that have been long undisturbed, generally stand still, and with fierce
looks and raised horns receive the first few shots in utter
astonishment, and then seek shelter in the high jungles with the utmost
speed. Rhinosceroses are very numerous in many parts of Assam, and are
to be found in very high grass jungle, near inaccessible miry swamps,
which preclude <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>pursuit, and having thick skins, they are not
easily shot. Elephants dread the charge of a rhinosceros as much as
that of a tiger, and the grunting noise of the former animal not
unfrequently scares even a well-trained elephant from the field. If the
rhinosceros succeeds in overtaking the elephant, he bites large pieces
of flesh from the elephant&rsquo;s sides or legs, and with the horn on
the nose not unfrequently inflicts fearful wounds. Rhinosceroses are
tamed in a few months, and may be seen at Gowahatty grazing on the
plains as harmless as cows, attended by a single man. When tamed in
Assam they may be bought of the natives for 100 or 150 rupees
(10<i>l.</i> or 15<i>l.</i>); many have been sent to Calcutta, and sold
for 500 rupees, or 50<i>l.</i>; but the expense of boat hire to the
metropolis, provender, and servants&rsquo; wages, with the risk
attendant on the journey to so distant a market, renders the
speculation anything but profitable.</p>
<p class="par">Deer shooting is a fine, healthy, exhilarating exercise
for those who are not partial to the dangerous and exciting scenes
common to tiger, rhinosceros, and buffalo shooting. It is a mistake,
however, to suppose it tame, easy sport. Deer shooting requires much
practice: a steady foot and arm in a howdah, and a quick sight are
indispensable, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>if you would shoot either pigs or deer while
bounding rapidly over the plain.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">A most deadly poison is extracted from a kind of root
denominated Mishmee Bih (or poison) brought from the Mishmee country,
on the north-east quarter of Assam. With this the natives in Upper
Assam generally cover the tips of their arrows, and destroy elephants
for the sake of the ivory tusks. So powerful, so deadly is the effect
of the poison, that the slightest scratch or puncture of an arrow
smeared with it proves fatal: if not instantaneously, at all events in
a few hours after an elephant has been stricken. Deer and buffaloes are
also killed in the same manner. Immediately the animal falls, the
wounded part is cut out, and the flesh is then eaten by the natives,
without apprehension of any ill effects arising from the inoculation of
the body by the poison: at least I have never heard of a single
instance of a person losing his life from having eaten of the flesh of
animals killed by poisoned arrows, common as is the practice of
partaking of such food. Safety appears to be secured by excising the
wounded part.</p>
<p class="par">Of all field sports in Assam, that of catching wild
elephants with the noose is the most exciting and dangerous. On a herd
of wild elephants being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>discovered, four tame elephants,
called <i>Koonkies</i>, with two men on each elephant&mdash;one sitting
on the neck, and called a <i>Phundaet</i>, from having to throw the
noose, and the other seated on the back, with a club, to urge the
elephant into full speed&mdash;proceed to join the herd; which
generally at first sight of the tame elephants, takes to immediate
flight. A good sized wild elephant, however, being quickly selected
from the herd by the riders, by common consent, is pursued till fairly
run down, when the <i>Phundaet</i> throws over the wild
elephant&rsquo;s head a large rope noose, one end of which is attached
to the body of the tame elephant on which he is mounted, and the wild
animal is instantly pulled up and rendered helpless. The other three
tame elephants now joining, another noose is thrown over the wild
elephant&rsquo;s head on the other side; the ropes on both sides being
extended to a distance of ten paces. The entangled brute is then
triumphantly led off between the two tame elephants to a place of
security, where, his legs being bound with ropes to a large post in
front and rear, he is kept on low diet until he becomes
tractable,&mdash;a state to which he submits himself in an incredibly
short space of time. The female elephants may, in two months, be driven
alone anywhere; but the male elephants take four, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>six, and
sometimes twelve months before they can be trusted to walk alone,
unhampered with ropes. When a male elephant, with tusks, becomes
entangled with the noose round his neck&mdash;which noose, by the way,
has a knot to prevent strangulation&mdash;the animal frequently rushes
down with the utmost ferocity on the tame elephants, and with his tusks
gores them in a most frightful manner. In such a case it becomes
necessary to quickly bind his legs with large ropes, and no further
resistance is then of any avail. The individuals who throw the noose
over the wild elephant&rsquo;s head are oftentimes in the most imminent
danger, but their agility in shifting their position to any part of the
body of the tame elephant, enables them to elude injury. The
tractability and sagacity of the tame elephant in making every effort
to secure the wild elephant by putting the ropes round his legs, is
very remarkable. Indeed, so cunning are the tame elephants,&mdash;so
intuitive is their apprehension of their duty&mdash;that there is
little difficulty in capturing the wild elephant.</p>

<p class="figureHead">BUFALO SHOOTING IN ASSAM.</p>
<p class="par first"><i>London, Smith Elder &amp; C<sup>o</sup>. 65,
Cornhill</i></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">It is calculated that not less than five hundred
elephants are yearly caught in Assam and sent to Western India for
sale. At Chittagong, in the south-eastern quarter of Bengal, the mode
of catching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name=
"pb33">33</a>]</span>wild elephants is very different from that adopted
in Assam. Herds of fifty elephants are there surrounded by two or three
hundred men, the jungle is filled, and a regular barricade of trees,
with a trench, formed; the elephants are thus unable to break loose;
tame elephants are then sent into the enclosure, which is called a
Keddah, and the wild elephants are quickly secured with ropes.</p>
<p class="par">The formation of these enclosures is a work of great
labour and considerable expense; but the Government are amply repaid by
the sale of about one hundred elephants annually, caught in this
manner. Chittagong elephants are considered very superior to those
caught in Assam, the former being stout, strong, short-legged beasts,
and the latter lanky and weak; but whether the prejudice be just, may
be doubted, as there are many noble elephants in Assam that would prove
most serviceable in any part of India, and the prices they would fetch
amply repay any charge incurred by Government for an elephant-hunting
establishment in Assam.</p>
<p class="par">The annual sum expended for the support of civil and
military establishments in Assam cannot, I suspect (for I have no
documents to refer to), be less than 700,000 rupees, 70,000<i>l.</i>
And the net revenue derived from six districts exhibited in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>following table<a class="noteref" id="xd24e992src"
href="#xd24e992" name="xd24e992src">1</a> is rupees 611,268 9 7,
showing that the disbursements exceed the receipts. This is to be
regretted, for disinterested individuals conclude that Assam might be
made a source of profit instead of expense to the Government, without
the smallest possible risk of the peace of the north-eastern frontier
of India not being maintained in security. But were it otherwise, the
sum yearly expended in excess of the net revenue for the management of
Assam, it must be borne in mind, is not thrown away, for Assam forms
the best frontier protection for Bengal that could be desired; and if
troops were not located in that province, a force would be required on
the north eastern frontier, involving much heavier expense than the
Local Corps of Assam. Every endeavour, therefore, to promote the
advancement and civilization of the people of Assam must be hailed as a
favourable omen of future prosperity.</p>
<p class="par">The utter want of an industrious, enterprising spirit,
and the general degeneracy of the Assamese people, are greatly promoted
by the prevalent use of opium; they would rather consent to be deprived
of food than their accustomed dose of this deleterious drug, and so
emaciated and weakened have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href=
"#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>many become from indulging in its
use, that they are unequal to any great exertion, either mental or
bodily, until the usual stimulating dose has been imbibed. Government
have established no regulations against the growth of opium in Assam,
neither do they derive any greater revenue from its cultivation than is
yielded them by other lands. It cannot be doubted that, if a heavy tax
were levied on every acre of land producing opium, and a high duty
imposed on its sale, it would be beyond the means of the people to
purchase and consume such quantities of the drug, as is now the
practice of men, women, and even children. The consequence would be
that in a few years many would be weaned from their predilection for
the pernicious opiate, which at present is esteemed a sovereign remedy
for every evil in life. Notwithstanding the degraded state of the
Assamese population, we may yet regard Assam as a rising country; the
price of all commodities, as well as the wages of labour, having been
greatly enhanced under the British rule.</p>
<p class="par">In concluding these brief notes on Assam, justice,
gratitude, and esteem, require that the personage holding the exalted
dignity of the Governor-General&rsquo;s agent in Assam, Major Francis
Jenkins, should be presented to the notice of the reader. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>It is to
him the English public are largely indebted for forming the grand
scheme of supplying his native country with tea from Assam. It is to
his able and persevering exertions, during a ten years&rsquo; sojourn,
that the affairs of Assam, both in a political and financial view, have
been retrieved from almost inextricable disorder. Before Major Jenkins
arrived, very few officers were allowed to conduct the political duties
of the province; and these gentlemen being, moreover, overwhelmed with
other business, improvements could not be contemplated: the current
routine of fiscal and criminal duties was all that two or three
individuals could be expected to superintend. This state of affairs was
remedied by Major Jenkins, who pointed out to Government the
indisputable advantages that would accrue from a more liberal policy
being pursued in aiding him with a greater number of European
assistants. His representations were acceded to; the revenue has
consequently increased, and the people, as far as their vices will
permit, have thriven in peace, security, and comfort. The British
Government has relieved Assam from the barbarous mutilations, cruel
impalements, and other outrages against humanity which its inhabitants
were subject to under their ancient rulers; and distress, anarchy, or
discontent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>amongst our own subjects in Assam is unknown. A
few petty aggressions of savage hill tribes occasionally occur,
demanding constant vigilance and prompt suppression, but with this
exception, peace and plenty prevail throughout the valley; and when the
day arrives for Major Jenkins&rsquo;s departure from Assam to his
native land, that liberal, benevolent, and highly-gifted man will be
much regretted by his European assistants, and by the native population
of the province, all of whom look up to him as a protector and
friend.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the reign of Rajeswur Sing, Rajah of Assam,
about 1751 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, on the north-eastern frontier
of Assam, the Khamtees, it is traditionally reported, emigrated from a
range of mountains bordering on the sources of the Irawaddy river to
the valley of Assam, and settled a small colony of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>fifteen
houses in the vicinity of the Tengapanee river. But between the years
1780 and 1794 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, Goureenath Sing, the
reigning Rajah of Assam, was compelled to abandon Upper Assam after
repeated battles with the rebellious Moamareahs of Muttuck, and in the
anarchy that prevailed throughout the country, the Khamtees were
emboldened to take up a more advanced position. For that purpose, being
joined by another band of 400 Khamtees with some few muskets, they
fearlessly located themselves at Suddeah; and, though nominally
subordinate to the Assam Government, they arrogantly exercised
considerable power over the people of the Suddeah and Saikwah
districts: which were exceedingly populous at that period, and had been
placed under the direct authority of an Assamese nobleman, styled
Suddeah Khawa, an Ahoom by birth. Not content with this usurpation,
they proceeded to reduce the whole of the Assamese population to the
utmost verge of degradation; considering them as slaves, only worthy to
be spared so long as they continued obedient to the will, and were
useful to their masters in cultivating the land, and contributing to
their comforts. In the height of their success, promoted by the
weakness of the Assam Government, the Khamtees commenced kidnapping the
Merees, and other inhabitants <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href=
"#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>settled in the neighbourhood of the
Dehong and Debong rivers, whom the Abors looked on as their dependants
and slaves, entitled to their special protection. This treatment being
less endurable than that of the Abors, towards whom a friendly feeling
had been created by long intercourse, the Merees were induced to
implore the protection of the latter to save them from being cruelly
taken away from their homes to serve as slaves amongst a strange tribe.
The Abors, on their side, perceiving that they were about to lose the
greater portion of their slaves by the aggressions of a formidable foe,
lost no time in preparing for war; and descending from their mountain
fastnesses to the plains bordering on the Dehong river, a furious
battle was fought between them, and, it is said, two or three hundred
Khamtees. The contest terminated in the Khamtees being defeated and
dispersed with great slaughter, upwards of one hundred men being left
on the field of battle. This trial of strength and courage with their
warlike neighbours, rendered the Khamtees ever afterwards more
circumspect in their demeanour towards the Abors, and the people
subject to them.</p>
<p class="par">During the reign of Kumleswur Sing Rajah, from 1794 to
1809, frequent battles were fought <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42"
href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>between the royal troops and
Khamtees, and generally to the discomfiture of the latter. In fact so
disastrous to the Khamtees were the results, that the whole tribe was
dispersed; many were detained prisoners, and the remainder were
compelled to quit Suddeah and return to the country whence they had
issued. In 1810, Chunderkant Rajah ascended the throne, and in the
commencement of his reign the Khamtees endeavoured to regain their lost
position. Joining the Singphoos at Suddeah, they attacked one of the
forts situated at the foot of the northern hills above Suddeah,
commanded by Bihitea Burrah and Kooch Burrah, and were successful in a
night assault, having destroyed the fortress by fire and massacred 150
soldiers. They were, however, speedily repulsed by the Assam troops,
and the whole clan was thenceforth expelled the province.</p>
<p class="par">In 1816&ndash;17, Chunderkant Rajah was treacherously
invited by the Borax Gohain to visit Jorehath, where he was formally
deposed, and ignominiously treated: having one of his ears slit, which
disqualified him for regal dignities; and Poorunder Sing, the great
grandson of Rajeswur Sing Rajah, was duly installed in his seat. This
arrangement, however, was of short duration, for in 1818 a Burmese army
of 30,000 men invaded Assam and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>replaced Chunderkant on his
throne. The ex-Rajah, Poorunder Sing, on this sudden and unlooked for
change of affairs, prudently retired to Chilmary, in Bengal,</p>
<p class="par">Under the Burmese Government, the Assamese at Suddeah
were placed under a Khamtee Gohain, or chief; and when the province was
conquered in 1824&ndash;25, Captain Neufville sanctioned the
innovation, bestowing on a Khamtee chief the title of Suddeah Khawa.
But the rights of the Assam <i>r&eacute;gime</i> had devolved on the
British Government, with whom it rested to revert to the former rule
wherever it might be deemed expedient: and that without any injustice
to the Khamtees, as they had no claim whatever to the title in
question. The assumption of the title of Suddeah Khawah, by the
Khamtees is variously described. It is currently believed that
Chunderkant Rajah&mdash;feeling himself insecure on the throne whilst
he had to contend with the Boora Gohain and the ex-Rajah Poorunder
Sing&mdash;invited the Khamtees to return to Suddeah, and bestowed on
one of the Khamtee chiefs the title of Suddeah Khawa; in order, by this
arrangement, to secure, through their means, a retreat for himself, if
unfortunate at a future day. But in 1820 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>,
the Burphokun having been murdered, with the connivance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>it was
supposed, of Rajah Chunderkant, the Burmese became his enemies, and
returned and dethroned him, shortly afterwards, placing on the throne
Jugesur Sing, who was the last prince of the Assam dynasty. In this
interval of anarchy, the Khamtees had re-established their influence
and power to such an extent as to overawe almost the whole of the
tribes of the frontier; and their authority at Suddeah was paramount.
The Assamese, though greatly reduced in numbers by oppression and
deaths, and from being carried off and sold into slavery by the
Singphoos and Burmese, were all now permanently under the control of
the Khamtees; but on the submission of the latter to the British
Government, a settlement was made with them, leaving the internal
management of the tribes to their own chiefs, who were exempt from
taxation, but under the obligation of performing military service to
the state when required. Revenue, however, was to be paid for the
Assamese subjects under their management, and cases of murder,
wounding, arson, and petty thefts above fifty rupees were disposed of
by British officers.</p>
<p class="par">The military population of the Suddeah district, on the
north bank of the Burrampooter, was estimated at this period to
be&mdash;Assamese, 691, Khamtees, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>428, men capable of bearing
arms: multiply these numbers by three, for old men, women, and
children, we shall reach a census of 4476 souls. On the south bank, in
the district of Saikwah, according to the same calculation, there
were,&mdash;Assamese, 616, Khamtees, 248, which, with old men, women,
and children, amounted in all to 3456 persons; thus making the united
population on the north and south banks of the Burrampooter, in the
districts of Suddeah and Saikwah, 7,932 persons.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1829, notwithstanding the Khamtees were
bound by treaty to pay allegiance to the British Government, such was
the intriguing character of the Khamtee Suddeah Khawa Gohain, that the
strongest ground existed for believing him to be engaged in a
traitorous combination against us. He was the first person who invited
the Burmese into the country, and having a relative residing at Ava, he
maintained not only with that court, but throughout the frontier, a
general correspondence. In the absence of a European military officer,
or Political Agent at Suddeah, a native manager or Suznatee, was
generally the channel of all communications between the chiefs and the
British Government. But in the years 1834&ndash;35, Captain Charlton
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>was placed in charge of the Khamtee chiefs, and
the Suddeah and Saikwah districts; and by the measures he adopted to
check the traffic in slaves, and protect the Assam population from the
oppressive exactions of the Khamtees, he created the utmost
dissatisfaction among the latter, and caused them to be highly
incensed. Moreover, in December 1834, instructions were issued
requiring a census of the population to be taken; with the view of
levying a capitation tax, to be renewed every five years, in lieu of
military service to the state. When this innovation was proposed, it
was urged that the state of society among these tribes was such, that
the materials for direct taxation were not available; that the
introduction of our rule would cause too violent a shock to the habits
and usages of the rude people; and that the result, in all probability,
would be a harassing rebellion, which would retard the progress of
improvement. Concurring in these views, the Government deemed it unsafe
fully to enforce the plan of assessment. The Assamese residing within
the Suddeah territory were taxed at the rate of one rupee per head; but
the Khamtee tribes were exempted from this imposition, on condition of
their performing military service as they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb47" href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>had hitherto done under
the Assamese and British Governments.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding this concession, however, an
insubordinate spirit was immediately manifested by the tribes, and it
thus became necessary to deprive them of the muskets given them by
Captain Neufville, and to depose the Khamtee Suddeah Khawa Gohain. The
loss of this title and usurped sovereignty over the Assamese was
grievously felt by the Khamtees, and from that period their
estrangement from the British Government may fairly be dated. About
this time, also, the Khamtee Suddeah Khawa Gohain was arraigned on a
charge of slave-dealing,&mdash;an unfortunate occurrence, which
rendered the Khamtee chiefs still more indisposed to our rule. Serious
apprehensions were thenceforth entertained of an open revolt, and
combination with our enemies. Nevertheless, not to appear distrustful
of their intentions, they were invited to accompany Lieut. Charlton, in
the rainy season of 1835, in the expedition against the Duffa
Gaum&rsquo;s force at the stockade of Gackwah; in storming which place
the Runowa, the Tow Gohain of Derack (who was wounded in the neck), and
the Captain Gohain accompanied him, and were said to have behaved
bravely, and been present when Lieut. Charlton was wounded.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>It was confidently asserted, however, that though
these chiefs did accompany Lieut. Charlton when he took the advanced
stockade or guard-house, there were not more than five or six men in
it, who ran away immediately; and it is probable that the Khamtee
chiefs were aware of there being so few men, as they afterwards
completely abandoned Lieut. Charlton when he so gallantly attacked the
large stockade. Indeed, from the whole of their conduct subsequently,
there is every reason to conclude that they were in league with the
enemy, for they made no attempt to obstruct his retreat, and said
openly that they could not be expected to fight now that a census was
taking of their subjects for the purpose of assessing them; and that
they got no presents as was formerly the custom. In the cold season of
1835, the Political Agent led another expedition against the Duffa
Gaum, and accepted the voluntary offer of the Khamtee chiefs to
accompany him: not in a well-grounded belief in the sincerity of the
proposal, but as a matter of policy, with the view of rendering the
Duffa Gaum doubtful of their intentions; and thinking it safer to keep
an eye upon them, whilst close at hand, rather than to leave them in
the rear. In these operations, all previous suspicions of their
disaffection were completely confirmed, for in no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>one
instance did the principal chiefs afford any support, and they even
took care not to place their contingents within fire on the first day.
Subsequently, when placed on the line of the Duffa Gaum&rsquo;s
retreat, they made no effort to obstruct it, otherwise the chief would
have been captured; and there is every reason to believe that the
<span class="corr" id="xd24e1344" title=
"Source: negociation">negotiation</span> was entirely defeated through
their efforts, in concert with others.</p>
<p class="par">The difficulty, however, of substantiating matters of
this kind in this frontier, amongst these wild tribes, is exceedingly
great, for a great deal of correspondence on such subjects is carried
on by symbols and tokens: such as pieces of buffalo flesh, short
swords, muskets, ball, powder, &amp;c.; but at the very time the
Khamtees were posted to cut off the Duffa Gaum&rsquo;s retreat, one of
their chiefs deserted to him, and doubtless gave the intelligence the
enemy stood in need of; and it is currently reported that they fired on
the British troops, with whom they were co-operating, more than on the
enemy. It is even believed that the Khamtees were aware of the Duffa
Gaum&rsquo;s irruption from the first, and promoted it, with the view
of finding us occupation on the frontier, and thereby preventing the
realization of our plans for assessing them, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>they
were firmly impressed with the belief that it was our intention to
reduce them to a level with the Assamese. It is true that they offered
to pay taxes at one rupee per head, on condition of being exempted from
military service, but that they were sincere in this offer was not
credited: had the measure been enforced, they would probably have
resisted it, or moved out of our territory.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of 1837, a marked spirit of
disaffection existed amongst the Khamtee chiefs, and it was generally
understood that they had combined with the Abors and Mishmees to
subvert our power; and they had probably encouraged the Abors to attack
us, in the hope of making themselves of consequence and thereby
recovering their former power over the Assamese. Or it might have been
with a view of preventing the extension of taxation to themselves,
which, notwithstanding our promises to the contrary, they expected
would be enforced when necessary or convenient. In the latter end of
1837, the Khamtees made an inroad on the Mishmees, averring that the
Mishmees had taken away their slaves some years ago; but there is no
record of the existence of any real pretext for violence. On the
contrary, it appears that the Khamtees sold the subjects of the British
Government <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>to the Mishmees. The real motive for the incursion
is supposed to have been that the Runoah and Tawah Gohains intended
proceeding to a particular spot in the Mishmee hills, with the view of
expelling a portion of that tribe and of ultimately withdrawing
themselves from the authority of the British Government, to which they
had evinced no cordial feeling of attachment. In fact, both in 1835 and
1837 it was recommended to the Government that the Khamtees should be
located elsewhere than at Suddeah, in order that unpleasant collisions
might be avoided, and our peaceable Assamese subjects be induced more
cheerfully to submit to taxation.</p>
<p class="par">The only incident that transpired worthy of notice in
1838 was that, without any permission, the Khamtees commenced preparing
some lands for cultivation about a day&rsquo;s journey from Suddeah;
alleging as their reason the scarcity of good land at Suddeah. This
plea was, however, untenable: the real cause was that the paucity of
the population at Suddeah had rendered it necessary for the Government
officers to make requisitions for coolies to work on the roads,
although considerably higher wages had been paid than in other parts of
the country, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>and the dread of these requisitions had induced
the Khamtees to think of removing.</p>
<p class="par">Thus passed the years 1836, 37 and 38: rumours of an
insurrection being about to break out were occasionally prevalent, but
it was supposed that the Khamtees had too much good sense to league
with other lawless and disaffected tribes and hazard a rebellion,
unless supported by a large Burmese army. In the following year,
however, the deceitful calm was suddenly disturbed. About half past 2
o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 28th January, 1839, the clouds that
had long been gathering, burst on the doomed post of Suddeah. The
Khamtees, including a few Moolooks and Singphoos and others, in number
about six hundred fighting men, divided into four
parties&mdash;impressed with their own importance and strength, and
perhaps stimulated to greater daring by opium&mdash;insidiously set
fire to the houses of the officers and huts of the soldiers and camp
followers, at different points; at the same time furiously attacking
with short swords, spears, &amp;c., the stockade and Assam Light
Infantry in their lines, and the quarters of the artillery.
Notwithstanding that the attack was totally unlooked for, and the
greatest confusion prevailed from the extensive conflagration and
uproar throughout the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>station&mdash;the Sipahees being surrounded
by their wives and families, and knowing that the enemy cut up men,
women, and children, indiscriminately&mdash;the panic was of short
duration. Discipline soon came into play; a few men got together,
headed by their officers, and retook the stockade in fifteen minutes.
The enemy then confined their remaining exertions to cutting up a few
helpless individuals in the bazaar; but after a few rounds of grape and
round shot from a carronade and a six-pounder which had been fired, at
the commencement of the attack, they fled from the cantonment of
Suddeah in three bodies, leaving behind them twenty-one men killed on
the spot. The loss of killed and wounded on our side, including men,
women, and children, amounted to eighty persons. The political agent,
Lieutenant-Colonel White, who had only arrived at Suddeah a few days
before the attack, placing too much confidence in the illusive
permanence of Khamtee allegiance, did not deem it necessary to have for
his protection a guard of Sipahees at his house; and on this eventful
night he had left his bungalow on the first alarm, and was proceeding
by the nearest route to the lines, when he was met by a party of the
enemy, who instantly attacked him. He fell, pierced with nine spear
wounds. It is a matter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>of great regret that this officer should have
lost his life from the want of proper precaution, for, had a guard been
placed at his house, there is little doubt but that he would have
fought his way in safety to the troops in the lines, as other officers
did. Being a benevolent, brave, talented officer, his death was deeply
lamented by the corps; more particularly as he was the only European
who met an untimely end on this memorable morning.</p>
<p class="par">The Khamtees, it is reported, had long endeavoured to
persuade the Singphoos to join them in their intended outbreak and
massacre of our troops, and some had assented to share in the promised
plunder of the district; but whether they hesitated from fear of the
consequences, or that the Khamtees anticipated the day of attack from a
sanguine expectation of accomplishing their design through their own
prowess, unassisted by other tribes, we had no means of ascertaining:
further than that the Singphoos, excepting a few in the neighbourhood
of Suddeah, on this occasion showed their foresight and prudence in not
being implicated in the reckless rebellion. But as the Singphoos,
immediately after the Suddeah catastrophe, attacked and burnt several
villages in the Saikwah district, it is evident they were prepared to
take advantage of the surprise <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55"
href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>of the post had our troops been
defeated or annihilated.</p>
<p class="par">The Moolooks engaged in this conspiracy were well
affected to the British Government, and at first refused to join the
Khamtees in attacking our troops; but the Moolook Gaum, or chief,
having been instantly barbarously murdered by the Khamtees for
declining to act against us, his little band was intimidated and
compelled reluctantly to follow the dreaded Khamtee leaders. A few
Mishmees, who were also at this time on a visit to Suddeah for trading
purposes, were unfortunately induced to join in the treacherous affray,
and many that were fighting for their lives were slain by the troops.
Some of the Suddeah Assamese population were likewise implicated, and
punished by the law with the severity their temerity and ingratitude
deserved: for they had received no provocation, neither had they any
grievances to resent or redress.</p>
<p class="par">In a few months the Khamtee tribe (excepting the
Khamtees of Palangpan, who were not implicated) were driven by the
Assam Light Infantry beyond the frontier; and the Assam valley was, for
the third time within a century, freed from the presence of this
inimical tribe. Shortly after the return of the troops from this
expedition, however, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56"
name="pb56">56</a>]</span>the Khamtees again located themselves at the
foot of the Mishmee hills, close to a pass leading into the Burkhamtee
country. In 1843, the Runoah Gohain and Tow Gohain, chief actors in the
dire disaster of 1839, being dead, their sons and many Khamtees, sent
in a petition for pardon, and for permission to return and place
themselves under the protection of the British Government. Their prayer
was generously acceded to, and a treaty was at once drawn up offering
them free pardon for the past rebellion: on condition of their coming
down with their wives and families and locating themselves at
Choonpoorah, a short distance above Suddeah, where they should be
permitted to cultivate the land rent free for five years. They were
further bound to abstain from the trafficking in slaves, and to arrange
all petty disputes amongst themselves; but all heinous offences,
murder, gang robbery, serious wounding and thefts, were to be settled
by the political agent. Finally, after ten years they were to abide by
any other arrangement the British Government might deem expedient.
Previous to this settlement, and shortly after the insurrection of
1839, a small body of Khamtees were sent down to the district of
Luckimpore, and by their own industry cleared and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>brought
into a beautiful state of cultivation a fine tract of country. They,
however, live most secludedly from their neighbours, retaining their
own habits and customs; and it is to be feared that a long period of
time will elapse before they amalgamate or assimilate themselves with
the Assamese population. Eventually, should the whole body of this
discontented, restless, intriguing tribe return to their allegiance
under the British Government, their past history would not warrant the
most sanguine mind to expect from them, permanently, either a cheerful
submission to our rule or a readiness to pay revenue, without an
exhibition of force. Neither can we confidently anticipate that they
will adopt peaceable, agricultural, industrious habits in the present
generation; being addicted to opium and habitual indolence, and
preferring the precarious gain derivable from bartering ivory, gold,
and impure silver, to the drudgery of regular industry. But it is
impossible to calculate on the benefits and changes that might be
effected in their feelings and character, could they be prevailed on to
have their children educated in our schools; and this scheme for their
amelioration has long been contemplated.</p>
<p class="par">In stature the Khamtees are middle sized, in countenance
resembling the Chinese more than any <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>other tribe on the
frontier, and possessing the same kind of complexion: perhaps a shade
darker. They are an active, intelligent, shrewd, warlike looking race
of men, but there is a sinister expression, mixed with a peculiar
severity, pervading their countenances, that leaves anything but a
favourable impression of the benevolence of their dispositions.
Vindictive and cruel natures would infallibly be imputed to them by the
physiognomist, and experience has shown that this would prove a just
estimate of their general character. The chiefs of this tribe are fond
of mechanical employments, and with rude instruments most ingeniously
work up iron and silver into a variety of forms for arms, ornaments,
and pipes. With a little European instruction they would probably
become skilful workmen in this art. Their wearing apparel consists of a
simple dhotee or sheet folded round the waist and falling below the
knee; this, with a dyed blue cotton jacket extending below the waist
and well fitted to the body, gives them a smart, tidy appearance. Their
long hair is bound up in a high knot on the crown of the head, and
sometimes a white cotton cloth is used as a turban. The principal food
of the Khamtees consists of rice and vegetables; but meat, when
procurable, is never refused. They also enjoy <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>spirituous liquors; and their creed, Boodhism,
seems to have imbued them with few prejudices debarring them from the
unrestrained indulgence of their natural inclinations.</p>

<p class="par">The Singphoo tribes occupy the country between the
twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth degrees of north latitude, bounded on
the north by the Burrampooter, on the east by the Mishmee mountains, on
the south by the Patkoe range, and on the west by the space from the
mouth of the Now Dehing river, debouching into the Burrampooter in a
direct line to Ningroo, terminating at the foot of the hills south of
the Boree Dehing river. Half of this tract, of about 1,400 square
miles, may be considered hilly, and the remainder undulating. The soil
is rich and fertile, and abundant crops of rice are easily raised both
on the high and low lands. Sugar-cane grows luxuriantly; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>tea is
likewise found, and every part of the country is intersected by fine
clear streams. The most productive corn tracts are the valleys of the
Teerap, Namroop, Boree Dehing, Now Dehing, Mudhoopanee, Tengapanee, and
Kurempanee. Almost the whole of this country, at the present time, may
be said to be one immense forest, but about sixty years ago, or
previous to the arrival and settlement of the Singphoos within the
Assam frontier, it was considered, from the great extent of
cultivation, a fertile, salubrious region. The Singphoo population was
estimated in 1838 at about 6000 persons; but in the absence of a
regular census, we can form no accurate estimate of their real numbers.
At the present day their communities are very small: probably 6000
persons would not be found scattered over the whole frontier north of
the Patkoe range. In the vicinity of the Tengapanee, the following
Singphoo chiefs reside:&mdash;Niphoonnong, Tangsangtau, Jowbongsang,
Nidong, Koonkie, Phoop, Oompheedor, Luttora, Ong, Keemingdoo, Niyang,
Lajee, Mannong, Nakinchong, Nisah, Koomiyunglah, Ninayong, Jooloo,

<p class="par">Each of the different Singphoo tribes is governed by a
chief, designated a Gaum, whose authority over his clan is nearly
despotic, and entirely independent of the other chiefs. The general
body of clans seldom combine, except for purposes of plunder.
Occasionally, however, some chiefs, endowed with superior energy,
acquire influence over the rest; and this would appear to have been the
case with the Beesa Gaum, when the late Mr. Scott, agent to the
Governor-General, entered into a treaty with the Singphoo chiefs. At
that time the Beesa Gaum was the most intelligent and influential of
the chieftains, and was publicly recognised as the agent through whom
the sentiments of the British Government should be made known to the
different tribes. In other respects he had no controlling authority,
and was regarded by his brother chieftains as merely their equal. On
the invasion of Assam by the Burmese, the Singphoos joined the force,
and partook of their plunder; in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62"
href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>fact, they had no alternative:
their only option was to plunder others or to be plundered.</p>
<p class="par">Prior to the conquest of Assam by the British power, the
Singphoo tribes had been accustomed to make annual incursions into the
province, for the purpose of obtaining slaves and plunder; but on the
establishment of a British force at Suddeah, this practice was
effectually restrained. From this circumstance arose their dislike to
our power, which readily disposes them to listen to any adventurer who
holds out to them the prospect of driving us out of the country; for
with the reckless and short-sighted policy of barbarians, they never
calculate the consequences of a revolt, but think that if the British
troops were defeated, and our influence annihilated, all their desires
would be accomplished.</p>
<p class="par">The Burmese having been driven from the province, in
1824&ndash;25, by our troops, and the Singphoos completely subdued, it
became necessary to adopt measures for the establishment of our future
intercourse with the latter; and for this purpose, on the 3rd of May,
1826, a treaty was entered into with them, granting them terms they had
no reason to expect. The following is a copy of the compact:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Whereas we, the Singphoo chiefs named Bam,
Komjoy, Meejong, Jow, Chowkhen, Jowrah, Chow, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>Chumun,
Neenjun, Tangrang, Chowbal, Chumta, Chowrah, Chowdoo, Chowkam,
Koomring, &amp;c., are under the subjection of the British Government.
We execute this agreement to Mr. David Scott, the agent to the Governor
General, and hereby engage to adhere to the following terms, viz: 1st.
Assam being under the sway of the British Government, we and our
dependent Singphoos, who were subjects of the Assam state, acknowledge
subjection to that Government. We agree not to side with the Burmese,
or any other king, nor to commit any aggressions whatever; but we will
obey the orders of the British Government.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;2dly. Whenever a British force may march to
Assam, to protect it from foreign aggression, we will supply that force
with grain, &amp;c.; make and repair roads for it, and execute any
order that may be issued to us; and we shall, on our doing so, be
protected by that force.</p>
<p class="par"><span class="corr" id="xd24e1425" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>3rd. If we abide by the terms of this
agreement, no tribute shall be paid by us; but if any Assam Paicks, of
their own accord, reside in our villages, the tax on such Paicks shall
be paid to the British Government.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;4th. We will set at large, or cause to be
liberated any Assam people whom we may have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>seized,
and they shall have the option to reside wherever they please.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;5th. If any of the Singphoos rob any of the Assam
people residing in our country, we will apprehend the former, and
surrender him to the British Government; but if we fail to do so, we
will make good the loss thus sustained by the latter.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;6th. We will govern and protect the Singphoos
under us, as heretofore, and adjust their differences; and if any
boundary dispute occur amongst us, we will not take up arms without the
knowledge of the British Government.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;7th. We will adhere to the terms of this
agreement, and never depart from them. This agreement shall be binding
upon our brothers, sons, nephews and relatives in such way as the Agent
to the Governor-General may deem proper. We have executed this
agreement in the presence of many. Written at Suddeah, 5th May, 1826,
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Singphoo country remained undisturbed until the year
1830, when the invasion of Wakim Koomjoon, from the province of
Hookong, on the Burmese side, took place, and was promptly repelled by
Captain Neufville. On this occasion, the Luttora and Tengapanee
Singphoos took part with the invader, and the Beesa Gaum with the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name=
"pb65">65</a>]</span>British authorities. The assistance of the Beesa
Gaum does not appear to have been of a very active nature, but his
conduct was nevertheless approved by the Political Agent, and rewarded
by Government. He was, however, shortly afterwards dismissed from the
situation of Sunzatee, and Zalim Sing, a Soobadar of the Assam Light
Infantry, who had greatly distinguished himself under Captain
Neufville, was appointed to the office. Bijee Nath Sing, a Soobadar of
the Assam Light Infantry, succeeded him in 1839.</p>
<p class="par">In 1835, the attack of the Duffa Gaum upon the Beesa
took place. This compelled the British Government to interfere for his
protection, and to avenge the massacre of its subjects; but although
the attacking party came from Hookong, the contest was in reality
between the Khakoo Singphoos, under the Luttoora chief (who espoused
the Duffa&rsquo;s cause), and the Now Dehing and Booree Dehing
Singphoos, on the side of the Beesa; for the Duffa only brought fifty
muskets with him and one hundred followers, the remainder of his force
being collected within the British boundary.</p>
<p class="par">The feud between the two rival chieftains, the Duffa and
the Beesa, arose in 1823 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, two years before
the assumption of the sovereignty of Assam <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>by the
British Government. A Singphoo chief of rank, named Likhee Khandoo, who
had lately come over from Hookong, had proposed to the Beesa Gaum that
the Singphoos, in conjunction, should attack the Bursenaputty, or chief
of the Muttucks. The Beesa chief replied that he would willingly join
provided the Duffa Gaum was of the party; the latter was applied to,
but refused to engage in the enterprise; nevertheless the attack was
made by the Singphoos, but was repulsed with severe loss to them, the
Muttucks having received secret information which enabled them to
prepare to receive the assailants. The prior intelligence of the attack
which the Bursenaputty had received, was ascribed, whether justly or
unjustly, to the Duffa chief&rsquo;s agency. Accordingly, in a spirit
of revenge, the remaining Singphoos attacked his house, wounded his
wife (who died from the effects of her wounds), and killed some of his
people. It is not certain that the Beesa chief was present at this
outrage, but as the party went from his house, there can be little
doubt of his connivance at the transaction. After this the Duffa chief
withdrew into the district of Hookong, under Burmese control; and
although repeatedly invited by the British authorities to return and
resume his territory, he never could be prevailed on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name="pb67">67</a>]</span>to do
so. Nor did he ever make application to obtain redress for the injuries
he had sustained from the Beesa chief prior to the conquest of Assam by
the British Government, and it was evidently never his intention to
apply. Indeed, it would have been incompatible with Singphoo notions of
honour that a chieftain should have obtained redress in this manner
without retaliating upon his enemy. With this latter view, ever since
his retreat from Assam, he had been gradually labouring to extend his
influence amongst the Singphoos, across both the Burmese and Assam
sides of the boundary line; and possessing the advantage of birth,
superior connections, and a reputation for liberality, he at length
succeeded in establishing an ascendancy paramount to that of the Beesa
chief: which had latterly declined, owing to his connection with the
British Government. The Beesa chief, and those dependent upon him, had
been compelled to give up the Assamese who returned from slavery in
Burmah&mdash;a measure extremely repugnant to the Singphoos, dependant
as they were upon the Assamese for the means of subsistence.</p>
<p class="par">Matters stood in this position up to July 1835, when the
Duffa Gaum, having obtained decided influence, planned an expedition
into the Beesa&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>territory, and appearing there unexpectedly,
surprised and plundered his village, murdered his wife, his son&rsquo;s
wife, and ninety of his people: thus retaliating in a far greater
degree the injury he had sustained. On hearing of this outrage,
Lieutenant Charlton ordered out a company, and instructed the Soobadar
to inform the Duffa Gaum that he must forthwith quit the Assam
boundary, and that, on reaching the frontier, any complaint he had to
prefer against the Beesa chief would be promptly attended to. The Duffa
chief refusing to comply with the mandate, Lieutenant Charlton was
obliged to employ force against him; but the troops under Lieutenant
Charlton&rsquo;s command being insufficient for the purpose, three
months afterwards (in November 1835) the political agent in person
moved to his assistance with two hundred and fifty men of the Assam
Light Infantry.</p>
<p class="par">The Duffa Gaum, anticipating an attack, had taken up a
strong position in the stockades on the Menaboom hills. Prior to
resorting to hostilities, every exertion was made to induce the chief
to come to terms, and a three days&rsquo; truce was granted for this
purpose. The Khamtee chiefs and the Bursenaputtee of Muttuck, who
accompanied the political agent as auxiliaries on this occasion, were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>required to escort the Duffa Gaum to the camp of
the Political Agent as a security that his person would be respected,
and that he would be permitted to return unmolested should no
satisfactory result follow the meeting. The Duffa Gaum, however, being
still apprehensive of treachery, could not be prevailed upon to attend
the conference, until the Political Agent consented to meet him at a
spot one hundred and fifty yards distant from his fort, with an escort
of only a havildar and twelve soldiers. The escort having been
scrupulously counted, the chief at last came out with a similar number
of armed followers. His demeanour was most abject: he and his whole
escort sunk down upon their knees, and taking a handful of the earth,
he kissed it and said that the Company was Lord and Master thereof. He
then proceeded to speak of the injuries he had sustained from the Beesa
Gaum. In reply, he was told that he had no reason to complain of the
British Government, as he had never represented the conduct of the
Beesa chief to any of the functionaries, and that it could not be
expected that the Government should take cognizance of acts which had
occurred in 1823, prior to its assumption of the sovereignty of Assam.
The injuries which the British Government had sustained from him were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name=
"pb70">70</a>]</span>then recapitulated: the murder of its subjects,
the plunder of their property, and the Duffa Gaum&rsquo;s stubborn
persistence in retaining his position in the face of repeated
injunctions that he should withdraw from the territory within the Assam
boundary. It was further brought to his recollection that the British
Government had repeatedly offered him repossession of his territory,
provided he came in a peaceable manner, but that it was incompatible
with its dignity to allow him to attempt to extort by force that which
had been given spontaneously. He was then required, First, to make
good, by an annual instalment in money, elephants&rsquo; teeth, or gold
dust, the loss of 8000 rupees that our merchants had sustained by his
treacherous attack on Beesa: furnishing security, or a hostage, for the
fulfilment of his engagement; and, Secondly, to dismiss the auxiliary
Singphoos whom he had brought from the Burmese territory: and as a
security for their not returning he was to give up their arms. The
Duffa Gaum agreed to both these propositions, apparently in the most
joyful manner, and promised faithfully to come in the following
morning; but the next day he sent a letter into camp referring entirely
to his ancient dispute with the Beesa chief, and making no allusion
whatever to the terms proposed to him. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>Upon this, the British
force took up a position within five hundred yards of his stockade; but
the Duffa Gaum&rsquo;s agent immediately came out and said, that if the
Political Agent would advance alone to a place within one hundred and
fifty yards of the fort, the chief would come out and accompany him to
camp. The Political Agent complied with the request, remained at the
appointed spot half an hour at considerable personal risk, and called
upon the Duffa Gaum to fulfil to his promise. The answer given was,
that the Duffa Gaum had no confidence in the sincerity of the Political
Agent, as Wakutchangnang had sent him a flint, powder and ball, the
evening before: which was equivalent to an intimation that his
intentions were warlike whilst proposing peace. The Agent urged in the
strongest manner that no such message had been sent; but finding the
Duffa Gaum immovable, hostilities were reluctantly resorted to. A
signal was given to the battery, and the fire commenced; the stockade
was carried, and the Duffa chief fled beyond the frontier.</p>
<p class="par">Not the slightest doubt was entertained of the
individual desire of the Duffa chief for peace; but the Khamtee chiefs,
being irritated by certain proposed innovations in 1834&mdash;such as
taking a census <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>and taxing them&mdash;were the first, it is
believed, to call in the Duffa chief, with a view of exciting troubles
and obstructing the maturity of our plans; and thus was the negotiation
marred.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1838 public tranquillity was again disturbed
by a feud between the Peshee and Let chiefs, which compelled the
British Government to interfere and punish the former: who, contrary to
his agreement, persisted in attacking the latter. The Luttora chief
likewise violated his compact, by giving aid to the Peshee chief, and
was driven from the Company&rsquo;s territory.</p>
<p class="par">Though the Tengapanee Singphoos did not arrive in time
to join in a body with the Khamtee chiefs, in the attack made on the
post of Suddeah in January 1839, their disaffection was apparent in
their unprovoked attack upon, and plunder of, the villages in the
Saikwah district, when they carried off many Dooaneahs. In consequence
of this outrage, a detachment of troops visited in November 1839, the
principal villages of Inshaw, Dobom, Inban, Luttora, Koomkie, and Tang
Sang Tang; situated at the foot of the Mishmee hills, between the
Kerempanee north, and Mena Boom hills south, in the vicinity of the
Tengapanee, which takes its rise in the Mena Boom hills south. On this
occasion the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name=
"pb73">73</a>]</span>whole of the chiefs were assembled, and the
heinousness of their late conduct explained: fines were imposed in
proportion to their means, and their submission and pledges required to
an extent never before obtained, besides the restitution of most of the
Dooaneahs carried away from Saikwah. The confederacy between the
Singphoos and Kamtees was broken up, and the expulsion of the Deerack
Tawah Gohain effected, with the loss of his village and a quantity of
grain.</p>
<p class="par">In November 1841, considerable alarm pervaded the
north-east frontier, owing to a report that the Tippum Rajah, aided by
the Burmese and Singphoos from both sides of the border, meditated an
incursion into Assam. To remove this impression, a tour was made by the
Political Agent with a company of the Assam Light Infantry, a body of
Golundaz, and two three pounders carried on elephants, through the
greater portion of the Singphoo territory. The route pursued was from
Saikwah up the Burrampooter river to the Tengapanee; and on passing the
villages of Kinglong, Dohing Koomkee, the principal chiefs, Neesaka of
Jusha, Ong of Luttora, Labing of Dobom, Tang Sang Tang, Koomong of
Koomkee, and Samnong, son of the Wakhet chief, paid their respects.
From thence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>the party proceeded up the bed of the Tengapanee,
by the site of the former village of Luttora, on to Naing and
Meerappanee, and commenced the ascent over the Mena Boom hills: a most
trying undertaking for elephants, as they had to travel along a narrow
ridge in some places only a few paces wide, and entirely composed of
loose stones; the sides frequently presenting dangerous precipices. It
was in descending this ridge that the laden elephants encountered the
greatest difficulty; yet they managed to get down without the necessity
of dismounting the guns, and reached Beesa and Ningroo in perfect
safety. The Singphoos thus learned the folly of trusting to their
stockades in their fastnesses, when guns could be brought against them
by moderate exertion and ingenuity. It was hoped that this tour would
also tend to repress the feuds so constantly arising amongst
themselves; seeing that justice could be administered even in retreats
the most secluded and difficult of access. But this expectation was not
realized; for in the year 1842 the Tippum Rajah (brother of Jegessur
Sing, the last rajah of Assam, said to be now governor of Hookong and
Mogong) sent the Beesa chief six pounds of needles, half of which were
broken, to be distributed by him amongst the Singphoos: a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>token or
signal of alliance and preparation for war. This intimation was
followed up in January 1843 by an attack on a party consisting of one
Jemadar, one Havildar, one Naick, and twenty Sipahees located in a
small stockade at Beesa. Some previous altercation had occurred between
the Jemadar and the Beesa chief regarding the repair of the stockade,
which not having been effected, the Jemadar had contemptuously called
the Beesa chief an old cow, and in return vengeance was vowed in
intelligible terms. After holding out for some days, three Sipahees
being killed and three wounded in the defence, the Jemadar was
unfortunately induced to surrender himself and party prisoners of war;
the treacherous Singphoos having assured him that the posts of Ningroo
and Koojoo had fallen into their hands, and our troops been totally
defeated. Trusting to their mercy and honour, he caused his men to
cease firing; and oaths were freely taken in support of promises of
good and honourable treatment; but the instant the Singphoos gained
admittance into the stockade, the Jemadar and the whole party were
disarmed and bound. The next morning the Jemadar and Havildar were led
out by the Singphoos and tied up to a tree, and fired at; after this
they were hewn to pieces with a short sword, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>on the
same spot where one of the Singphoos had been shot by the Jemadar when
in possession of the stockade. Nine of the Sipahees were sold into
slavery, some to Hookong and Burkhamtee. Thus signally did the
Singphoos gratify their revenge, at the commencement of the irruption
or attempt to break through the line of outposts and lay waste the
whole country.</p>
<p class="par">Their second and third attacks on the Koojoo and Ningroo
stockades, defended by European officers, were completely frustrated.
The Koojoo stockade was besieged for some days, but a sally being made
on the enemy whilst the Singphoos were at dinner, they were defeated
and fled in the utmost consternation. The Ningroo stockade was likewise
at night suddenly attacked and taken by surprise, but after a short,
sharp struggle, in which several lives were lost, the Singphoos left
the stockade in greater haste than they entered it.</p>
<p class="par">The Tippum Rajah&rsquo;s sister was married to the late
king of Ava, and she is supposed to be in favour with the present king.
It may be owing to her influence that the Tippum Rajah is reported to
be now Governor of Hookong, to take advantage of any opportunity to
invade Assam. Scarcely a year passes without some such reports being
spread <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>throughout the province, and there is great reason
to believe that the Singphoo insurrection of 1843 was raised at the
suggestion, or at least through the connivance of the Rajah; as many
Burmese or Shans under his jurisdiction crossed the frontier and joined
the insurgents in the hope of plundering the province. Had success
attended their first attempts, it cannot be doubted but that many more
would have soon followed their example, in the speedy removal of slaves
and property from Assam. But the real origin of the insurrection was
the occupation of the Koojoo tea garden and other tea tracts. The
constant desertion of the Dooaneah slaves and dependants, who are the
people chiefly employed in cultivation under the Singphoos, besides the
advance of civilization consequent on the establishment of a
considerable village at Jeypore with European residents, was the source
of much heart-burning. The occupation of Muttuck, formerly under native
management, must also have proved distasteful to a savage people
possessing a wild country and delighting in extensive hunting-grounds.
These circumstances, aggravated by frequent quarrels with the Sipahees
at Ningroo, the unauthorized apprehension of two Let Singphoos by the
Jemadar, and a desire of revenge for the execution, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>many
years ago, of Ningroola Gaum&rsquo;s kinsman, certainly contributed to
produce the insurrection of 1843.</p>
<p class="par">Viewing the nature of our connection with the Singphoos
generally, it must be acknowledged that the balance of advantage had
been decidedly in their favour; for while we have been called upon to
fight their battles, little or no assistance has, comparatively, been
afforded us by them. Being a rude, treacherous people, little faith can
be placed in them; neither can we expect they will be influenced or
bound by any treaties not in accordance with their own views: in fact
they have in no respect fulfilled their obligations to the British
Government.</p>
<p class="par">The Singphoo country is eminently unfavourable to the
operations of regular troops, owing to its mountainous character,
unrelieved by plains or table lands, the want of roads, the extreme
scarcity of provisions, the absence of local means of transport, and
above all the unhealthiness of the climate. The Government is likewise
put to a great expense without commensurate benefit, for in such a rude
and barbarous state of society revenue cannot be collected without the
employment of military force; and this is not always adequate to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>the success of hostile operations, because of its
paucity and the advantage afforded to the natives by the natural
defences of the country: of which they are not slow to avail
themselves.</p>
<p class="par">In reviewing the different tribes of Assam, it may not
be out of place to offer a brief sketch of one or two of the
chieftains.</p>
<p class="par">Wakut-chang-nang is the son of a Singphoo chief who
submitted to Captain Neufville in 1825, and received a present of a gun
and other articles from him, which he requited by firing upon the
captain a day or two afterwards. The ball missed Captain Neufville and
went through Lieutenant Kerr&rsquo;s hat without doing him any injury.
Subsequent to this, Wakut-chang-nang absconded to Hookong within the
Burmese boundary, and only returned in 1835 to the Assam territory.
During his sojourn within the Hookong territory he is stated to have
committed several murders; and with the money accumulated by crime and
robbery, he has been enabled to marry the Beesa Gaum&rsquo;s daughter.
From his having been the principal agent in breaking off the
negotiation with the Duffa chief, and consequently the cause of the
subsequent bloodshed, he was imprisoned during 1836&ndash;37 at
Bishnath. He is now residing at Beesa, and is considered, as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>heretofore, an intriguing, dangerous character.
The Beesa Gaum, having been implicated in the rebellion of 1843, is now
a state prisoner for life; he is nearly blind, and his career may be
said to have closed, as it is not probable he will survive many years.
He was supposed to be a man of good sense and to possess considerable
information regarding border politics, but of no enlarged capacity or
superior energy of character, and totally incapable of forming those
comprehensive designs which have been attributed to him. He is not of a
warlike character. Most of his battles have been fought by others: for
a Singphoo chief is not expected to head his troops in action.
Nevertheless his disposition is sanguinary, and it is said his career
has been marked by blood and treachery in a greater degree than usual,
even amongst the Singphoos.</p>
<p class="par">The Shan is the written character used by the Singphoos,
and their language is distinct from any of the neighbouring tribes:
they write on leaves and a peculiar kind of paper. As yet no European
has sufficiently studied the language to appreciate justly the Singphoo
literature, or to prepare elementary works for the guidance of others.
Nor are we aware of there being any written works in the language
either historical or theological. As <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>civil members of society
they are anything but good subjects, from their excessive laziness,
immoderate addiction to opium, and general uncertainty of character.
They are so indolent and improvident, that notwithstanding they have
the most fertile soil in Assam, which yields fruit with little labour,
and might be made to produce an abundant crop&mdash;notwithstanding,
too, their freedom from taxation, grain is always so extravagantly
dear, that during several months in the year the people are reduced to
subsist on yams and other roots found in the jungles. Almost the whole
of the field work is performed by the women and slaves, while the men
delight in lounging about the villages, and basking in the sun, when
not engaged in hunting or war.</p>
<p class="par">The religion of the Singphoos appears to be a mixture of
all the various idolatries and superstitions of the natives with whom
they have intercourse. They seem to have no fixed principles common to
the whole tribe. Their ostensible worship is that of Guduma, whose
temples and priests are to be found in all their principal villages.
They are also in the habit of deifying any Singphoos who may chance to
be killed in action during a foray upon some other tribe or village,
and of sacrificing to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82"
name="pb82">82</a>]</span>them as to their penates. On emergencies,
such as famine, pestilence, or danger, they make offerings to the
&ldquo;Ning Deota,&rdquo; God of the Elements, called also
&ldquo;Ningschees;&rdquo; sacrificing buffaloes, hogs, and cocks. The
skulls of the buffaloes so offered are afterwards hung up in their
houses as mementos of their own piety.</p>
<p class="par">Their funeral ceremonies are simple. The poorer classes
burn or bury the body, according to the previously expressed wish of
the deceased, and invariably make to the deity an offering of a pig,
fowl, or fish, through their Deodhies or priests. On the death of a
chief, numerous ceremonies are performed: the body is detained until
all the friends of the deceased can be assembled, when buffaloes, pigs,
and deer are sacrificed, a grand feast is given, and spirituous liquor
distributed to the company. The corpse is then committed to the earth,
the priest chants a prayer for the deceased, a clay tomb is raised over
the remains, and the grave is encircled with a bamboo fence. Sacrifices
are always offered up on the death of every Singphoo, according to the
means of the surviving relatives; no matter whether death be caused by
accident or war, or in the course of nature.</p>
<p class="par">Polygamy, without restriction, prevails among the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>Singphoos, and they make no distinction between
the children born of Singphoo women and those born of foreign or
Assamese women. They reject with horror the idea of infanticide, under
any shape or pretext. Marriage is only forbidden with a mother or
sister: they may marry stepmothers, brothers&rsquo; widows, or any
other relative. In the marriage ceremony the bridegroom has to present
the parents of the bride with a Khamtee Dhao, or short sword, a velvet
jacket, a silk Dhota, and a slave; the rich give gold and silver,
buffaloes, and as many slaves as the wealth of the bridegroom will
permit. The bridegroom has also to furnish a marriage feast to the
friends and relations of the bride; and after the Deodhies or priests
have performed a certain religious ceremony, the bride is delivered
over to the bridegroom, and the jewels, &amp;c., which are on her
person, are returned to her parents.</p>
<p class="par">If a man commits adultery, he is obliged to pay damages
according to the demand of the injured husband, in slaves, buffaloes,
dhoties, swords, money, or beads; and if he cannot pay the damages, he
pays the penalty of his crime in confinement. No damages are demanded
for the violation of an unmarried woman or virgin; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>but in
the event of her being found pregnant, the ravisher has to give the
parents three slaves and one buffalo, and the issue is claimed by the
man. It is optional with himself to marry his victim, or not. Theft is
punished by exacting from the thief double the value of the property
stolen.</p>
<p class="par">The Singphoos entertain strange ideas of honour and
revenge. Compatibly with their customs and rude notions of religion, a
Singphoo chief could not ever abandon, without dishonour, the
application of the <i>lex talionis</i> to one who had murdered his
relative; although, from circumstances of policy, or deficiency of
means, he might postpone the gratification of his vengeance to an
indefinite period. A mistaken feeling of religion, combined with
private affection for the deceased, fully accounts for this perverted
state of mind. The Singphoos imagine that the soul of the murdered
individual will torment them until his manes are appeased by the death
of one of his enemies; and further, that the anger of their deity would
be roused should an opportunity of retaliation be neglected. Nor is the
retribution to be limited to the actual perpetrator of the homicide. If
death be occasioned by violence committed, or supposed to be committed
by any one, the relations are never appeased until they have murdered
one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>of the family to which the murderer belonged. An
innocent person is thus often murdered, who is quite ignorant of the
injury committed by his tribe or family.</p>
<p class="par">The houses of the Singphoos are generally nothing but
long sheds, roofed in with grass or bamboo leaves, and the walls
composed of split bamboo. The floor of the dwelling part is raised
about four feet from the ground; and the entrance forms an extensive
porch, in which are congregated pigs, fowls, household and agricultural
implements, and where women may generally be seen pounding rice. These
buildings are sometimes one hundred feet long, and divided into
compartments allotted to several families. Occasionally immense houses
may be seen, which are occupied by powerful chiefs; the timbers of
these buildings being of such enormous size and length as to render it
a matter of surprise that they could have been erected by mere manual
labour. At the burning of the Ningrang chief&rsquo;s house, when the
village was surprised by our troops in 1843, the officers remarked that
the posts were of prodigious diameter and length; and it was regretted
that war rendered it necessary to destroy such a magnificent residence.
The mansion was entered by a flight of several steps leading up to the
floor, and was divided into numerous rooms by partitions of split
bamboo. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Singphoos have nothing approaching to what we call
government: each chief is independent, collecting no revenue, nor
directing in person any force, although he may influence the movements
of others. The Singphoos are of a tawny complexion, and a cunning
expression, with long bodies and short legs. They are implacable,
cruel, and treacherous; stealing upon and murdering with the short
sword at night those who have offended or injured them; and are ever
ready to coalesce for a foray, if there is a prospect of success.
Casualties that occur from the contentions of one tribe with another,
murders resulting from private jealousy, the difficulty of procuring
food, and exposure to the inclemency of the weather, help to keep the
population scanty all over the north-east frontier. In fact, the great
cause of the thinness of the population is the want of food, arising
from the absence of productive industry. The unsettled and lawless
state of society among the Burmese and Singphoos appears likewise to
operate in retarding the extension of trade; and this evil cannot be
rectified until these tribes are brought more completely under
subjection to the British Government. That once effected, a mart might
be formed at our extreme boundary; though the scantiness of the
population <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>in these regions would probably for some time
prevent the establishment of a very brisk trade.</p>
<p class="par">Hookoom is distant from Suddeah about 200 miles; a
miserable, desolate, backward country intervening: in fact, almost an
entire jungle throughout. At Moonkoom there would be a larger field for
commerce, as water communication by the Irawaddy is facile. Broad
cloths, &amp;c., could probably be conveyed thither cheaper, vi&acirc;
Rangoon, than from the Burrampooter. The same obstacles exist to
opening a trade between Assam and the provinces of Yunan, owing to the
greater proximity of Yunan to the Burmese empire. By all accounts a
considerable trade is carried on between the two countries, vi&acirc;
Bamow: a Burmese town within twenty miles of the confines of Yunan; and
from the facility of transport which the Irawaddy affords, we may infer
that British goods could be supplied at a cheaper rate, and with
greater safety, from Rangoon or from Moulmein through the Sangha, than
could be effected from Assam. The poverty of the people on this part of
our frontier is such that scarcely any one can afford to buy woollens,
excepting the chiefs, and even those persons generally receive them as
presents from the officers of Government. It would therefore be
desirable to send up articles of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88"
href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>less value. The articles chiefly
in demand are salt, cloths, tobacco, opium, knives, needles, cups and
saucers, basons and plates.</p>
<p class="par">In 1828, by way of experiment, and to test the
possibility of reviving trade, a Government investment of woollen goods
to the amount of 4000 rupees, was sent up to Suddeah; but it actually
took eight years before the whole stock was sold off, and it would not
then, probably, have been disposed of, had not the price been reduced
thirty per cent. below prime cost. It was sold during the first and
second years of its appearance in the market, at prime cost; afterwards
at a reduction of ten, twenty, and thirty per cent. Since then, a
trade, such as it is, has been established at Suddeah by native
merchants, at considerable risk; for the Government will not undertake
to give compensation for any losses the traders may sustain, either
from sudden attacks, or in their transactions with these wild tribes.
Notwithstanding the apparently hopeless prospect of any immediate
commercial intercourse taking place between Assam and any portion of
western China, there can be no doubt that as civilization advances, the
intervening tracts will be traversed, and a lucrative trade may then
connect districts now separated by dense forests. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It remains only to mention that, some difference of
opinion existing as to the boundary line between Assam and the Burmese
territory, it was deemed expedient to define the limits of both
countries by a special mission to the disputed point; and for this
purpose, in 1837, Dr. Bayfield was deputed to proceed from Ava and join
the Burmese Governor of Mogaum, and in the presence of Major White,
Political Agent of Upper Assam, to settle the question. Major White,
accompanied by Dr. Griffiths, Captain Hannay, and Lieut. Bigge, and the
neighbouring native chiefs, with ninety followers, accordingly set out
from Namroop Pathar, on the 19th February; and on the 25th of the same
month they reached Yaoung Sang Nullah, on the north face of the Patkoe
boundary, or range, where the Burmese governor had agreed that the
conference should take place.</p>
<p class="par">In this dreary wilderness of hills and jungle, the
impossibility of obtaining an adequate supply of provisions for ninety
persons (the commissariat being carried from the plains of Assam)
presented an insuperable obstacle to the prolonged stay of the party
with Major White. Having therefore waited till the 5th March, daily
expecting the arrival of the Burmese Governor and Dr. Bayfield; and the
whole of their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>provisions being consumed, with the exception of a
bare sufficiency for the wants of the party on their return, the Major
was constrained to retrace his steps to Suddeah. Captain Hannay,
however, pushed on unencumbered, in company with Dr. Griffiths (deputed
for scientific purposes to Ava), hoping to meet the Burmese Governor
and accomplish the object of the mission: which he did.</p>
<p class="par">On the 9th March, Captain Hannay and Dr. Bayfield
pointed out to the Burmese Governor of Mogaum the boundary line on the
summit of the Patkoe Mountains, and read to him an extract of the
treaty between the Rajahs of Mogaum and Assam, establishing the
boundary in 1323, <span class="sc">A.S.</span>, or 1402, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> The purport of this extract was that, in the year
1145, <span class="sc">A.S.</span>, equivalent to 1224 of the Christian
era, Sookhapah, the founder of the Ahoom Dynasty, having taken his
departure from Moonkhoom, invaded Assam; and, taking possession of the
country on the other side of the Patkoe range, he established Khanjang,
or Nunyangpanee, as the boundary: appointing the Bor Gohain to the
government of the district, and directing that the customary tribute
should be remitted to him in Assam. This settlement continued until the
year 1323, equivalent to 1402, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, during the
reign of Soodangpha, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href=
"#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>eighth Rajah of the Ahoon dynasty;
when a brother of his, named Towsoolie, having quarrelled with him,
went to Moonkhoom and instigated the Rajah to invade Assam. The attack
being, however, repulsed, an accommodation afterwards took place
between the two Rajahs, and the Patkoe range of hills was established
as the boundary. On this occasion a stone image was put up to indicate
the limits; and both the Rajahs, dipping their hands in the water,
vowed personal friendship, and swore reciprocally to respect each
other&rsquo;s territory. This compact remained unviolated for a period
of 400 years up to the period when the Burmese invaded Assam.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">MUTTUCKS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Muttucks were originally a rude tribe settled
in a district called Mooran or Muttuck, who prior to the Ahoom invasion
of 1224, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, had learned the doctrines of the
Hindoo religion from two Gosains named respectively Madho Deo, and
Sunkur Deo. The Gosains were followers of Krishen, and their doctrine
particularly differed from that of the other <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>Hindoos
of Assam, in their refusing to worship the images of Doorga. The
appellation of Moa Mureyas arose from its being the name of the place
where a Shuster was founded, and from which the doctrines of the
Muttucks emanated. They were allowed to exercise their religion
unmolested, until the reign of Seba Sing, between 1714 and 1744,
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>; when, animated by a spirit of sectarian
zeal, the Queen, Phoolsuree, inflicted a sore wound upon their
religious feelings by compelling them to worship the images of Doorga,
and to put the distinguishing marks of the followers of that deity on
their foreheads. But persecution, as usual, failed in checking this
sectarian spirit; and the numbers of the Muttucks having greatly
increased in the reign of Luckmi Sing, 1769, <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, they revolted from his authority. The immediate cause
of the first insurrection is attributable to two circumstances,&mdash;a
bigoted religious persecution, and a haughty, inconsiderate, oppressive
demeanour towards the Muttuck chiefs, and their adherents.</p>
<p class="par">Soon after the succession of Luckmi Sing to the throne
of his brother, Rajeswur Sing, Rajhan Mooran, a Muttuck chief, was
commissioned to procure a thousand elephants for Luckmi Sing, who was a
great admirer of these animals. The chief <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb93" href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>obeyed, and from time to
time he presented many elephants to the king. On one occasion, having
been unusually fortunate in capturing two hundred and fifty elephants,
he took them to the capital to show them to his Majesty; but as it was
customary to apprize the Bor Borowa of his intended visit, that the
circumstance might be previously announced to the King, he was
proceeding to the residence of that functionary, when he met the Bor
Borowa&rsquo;s son going on business to the King. Unfortunately he was
persuaded to accompany the young man, unmindful of the indiscretion of
deviating from the established rules of respect and courtesy to the Bor
Borowa.</p>
<p class="par">On Rajhan&rsquo;s arrival at the palace, the King
ordered his servants to prepare to attend him during the inspection of
the elephants. The Bor Borowa being obliged to be present on all such
occasions, and hearing that Rajhan Mooran had ventured to approach the
Rajah without the usual formality of an introduction, determined to
wreak his vengeance on the insolent Muttuck. Luckmi Sing inspected the
elephants, and was highly pleased with Rajhan Mooran&rsquo;s
promptitude and assiduity in the execution of his orders. He warmly
expressed his royal approbation of the conduct of the chief, and,
handsomely rewarding him, retired to the palace. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Bor Borowa now took the opportunity of sending for
Rajhan Mooran to learn his reasons for not having apprized him of his
arrival before he had sought an interview with the king. The excuse
pleaded by Rajhan Mooran was unheeded; the Bor Borowa was implacable,
and directed the infliction of a severe corporal punishment with the
cane. So strictly was this order executed, that Rajhan Mooran was cast
into the road in a lifeless state. Here he was recognised by his
countrymen, and conveyed away; and with good treatment, but not without
difficulty, he recovered.</p>
<p class="par">The undeserved insult and chastisement he had received
from the Bor Borowa, however, rankled deeply in his breast; and he lost
no time, when able to move, in proceeding to the Muttuck Gosain
Ushtobhoj,<a class="noteref" id="xd24e1597src" href="#xd24e1597" name=
"xd24e1597src">1</a> to claim his intercession in obtaining redress for
the insufferable dishonour he had been subjected to. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Moa Mureya Gosain Ushtobhoj, commiserating the
ill-treatment Rajhan Mooran had met with, resolved, a short time
afterwards, on visiting the Rajah to obtain reparation. He accordingly
set out with his Bhukuts, or religious disciples, and meeting the
Rajah&rsquo;s fleet on the river, he paid his respects to the Rajah,
contrary to the wishes of the Bor Borowa Keerteerchund, Prime Minister.
This conduct greatly incensed the Bor Borowa, who immediately sent for
the Gosain and treated him with great harshness and abuse, for the
temerity he had evinced in presuming to visit the Rajah without being
announced by himself. The Bhukuts who had accompanied him to the
interview were likewise ill-treated<span class="corr" id="xd24e1603"
title="Not in source">.</span> This indignity highly offended the
Gosain, and he determined to take an early opportunity of retaliating
the outrage. With this view, he took measures for ascertaining the
number of disciples and adherents he might rely on, and found, to his
satisfaction, that the census returned one hundred thousand
persons.</p>
<p class="par">The feelings of the Muttucks being now exasperated to
the highest degree by the degradations and insults to which they were
subjected by the Assam nobles; the present appeared to them a fitting
opportunity to rise and avenge their wrongs. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>The Bor
Deka, son of the Muttuck Gosain, having long entertained ambitious
views, encouraged Rajhan Mooran to assemble all the Muttuck chiefs and
followers willing to co-operate with them; expressing his belief that
with their united forces, success would attend their efforts. In the
mean time he remained quiet, the better to conceal his designs, and
commenced building a large mound near Jorehath, on which he intimated
his intention to found a Shuster, to be denominated the Bor Bhatee.
Each man who was willing to join in the insurrection was enjoined to
bring in one hand a lump of earth and in the other a reed. By this
device the Bor Deka&rsquo;s designs passed unobserved, and a multitude
of followers were ascertained to be ripe for the approaching
contest.</p>
<p class="par">Mohun Bor Jona Gohain, eldest brother of Luckmi Sing,
being marked with the smallpox, and a slit in the ear, was, by the
Assamese customs, disqualified from ascending the throne.
Notwithstanding this, however, with a view of concealing their real
designs, the Muttucks proposed to the prince to join the
insurrectionary force; promising to place him on the throne in the
event of the success of the insurrection. Tempted by the promise, the
prince joined the rebels, who immediately marched <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>towards
the capital at Rungpore, on the banks of the Dikho river. Luckme Sing
having been informed of the movement, ordered the Assam chiefs to
proceed and punish the insolent Muttucks, and bring him the ringleaders
of the insurrection. The rival forces met near the Thowra Dole Temple,
on the banks of the Dehing river, and after a slight skirmish, in which
their commander, the Doabyah Phokun, was killed, the Assamese were
defeated, and fled. Bhectorial Phokun then succeeded to the command,
and perceiving that Mohun Bor Jona Gohain, the elder brother of the
reigning king was at the head of the rebel force, not only refused to
oppose the prince and the invaders, but went and paid homage to the
Gosain. The Muttucks, thus meeting with no opposition, marched in and
took possession of the capital; and with such promptitude that Rajah
Luckme Sing and all his court were taken prisoners. Luckme Sing was
then incarcerated and harshly treated: food scarcely sufficient for his
subsistence being allowed him. The Bor Borowa Keerteerchund was seized
and put to death, with all his family, relations, and friends; and many
nobles also shared the same fate.</p>
<p class="par">Ramakant Bor Deka now took possession of the throne, and
Rajhan Mooran became Bor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Borowa; while the prince, Bor Jona
Gohain, who thus traitorously acted against his family and country, was
put off with the plea that he was incapacitated to reign as king by
reason of the personal mutilation already adverted to.</p>
<p class="par">A few months after this, a reaction took place. The
Assamese hearing of the indignities their king had suffered, and that
Chunder Deka, a younger brother of the Bor Deka, had actually struck
the king three blows with a cane for sitting in his presence when he
visited him in his confinement, they determined on expelling the
Muttucks from their country, either by force or stratagem. Numerous
chiefs and others readily entered into the spirit of the conspiracy. A
grand fete was to be given at the Bihoo festival in March 1769&ndash;70
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>; Rajhan Mooran and the Muttuck chiefs were
to be invited; and the Assamese were to attend with arms concealed
under their dress. Mogolee Jiekee Muneeporee,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd24e1623src" href="#xd24e1623" name="xd24e1623src">2</a> Queen both
of Rajeswar Sing and Luckme Sing, whom Rajhan Mooran had taken unto
himself, was to preside and be the principal agent <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>in the
accomplishment of the project. She was to persuade Rajhan Mooran to
accompany her to the dance, and when there, she was, if possible by
some subterfuge, to obtain possession of his sword, which he constantly
wore; and if his attention could be attracted to the dance she was to
cut him down, which would be the signal for the Assamese to fall upon
and slaughter the Muttucks. This diabolical plot, from the unanimity
and secresy of the conspirators, was executed with the most perfect
success. The Queen, who had obtained considerable influence over Rajhan
Mooran, without difficulty induced him to place his sword in her hand,
that he might, as she said, more easily arrange his dress, which she
had artfully managed somewhat to displace. While in the act of stooping
down, the Queen dexterously stepped behind him, and with one blow on
the hinder part of the thigh completely disabled him. The conspirators,
anxiously expecting the signal, instantly came up and put an end to his
existence. The Assamese then fell on the remaining unarmed Muttucks,
and a dreadful massacre ensued.</p>
<p class="par">The conspirators, having successfully carried through
their plot against Rajhan Mooran and the principal Muttuck chief,
proceeded to the residence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href=
"#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>of the Bor Deka Ramakant, the
usurper; his father, brothers, women, and children, were, with all the
principal parties, captured; but Ramakant, on hearing of the death of
Rajhan Mooran, had made his escape from the capital. He was, however,
seized near Bet-barree and brought back to pay the forfeit of his
ambition and rebellion. Luckme Sing was immediately released from
imprisonment and again placed on his throne. The first order issued by
the king after his restoration, was for the extermination of the
Muttucks. The usurper Ramakant Bor Deka, and his brother Chunder Deka,
as well as the Muttuck Gosain their father, were tied to the legs of
fierce, newly caught elephants, and ignominiously dragged round the
city, assailed with mud and filth and every kind of indignity that an
infuriated, relentless mob, intoxicated with triumph, could inflict;
and to close the scene they suffered the cruel and disgraceful death of
impalement. The Muttuck chiefs and their followers were everywhere
hunted down like wild beasts, and put to death: neither men, women, nor
children were spared. In fact, such was the animosity of the Assamese
against the Muttucks, for the time, that they seemed bereft of all
feelings of mercy or compassion. Vast numbers of the Muttucks
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>died of hunger in the jungles, and an
incalculable number perished by the sword of the insatiate
populace.</p>
<p class="par">Luckme Sing, being now under no farther apprehensions
for the safety of himself or throne, richly rewarded the actors in the
late tragedy with rank and wealth: and thus terminated the first
rebellion of the Muttucks.</p>
<p class="par">In 1784 the Moa Mareyas again rebelled, and having
expelled the Rajah Goureenath they proceeded to place two others upon
the Guddee, or throne, one named Bhurt Sing as Rajah of Rungpore or
Upper Assam, the other Surbamend (the father of Malebar Bursenaputtee,
who died in 1839) as Rajah of Mooran or Muttuck. Both these chiefs
marked their rule by establishing a mint, and some of their coins are
to be met with at the present day. Being driven from Upper Assam, the
Rajah Goureenath solicited the aid of the British Government; and his
request being acceded to, Captain Welsh was sent with one or two
battalions, in 1794, <span class="sc">A.D.</span> Having taken
Rungpore, Goureenath was replaced on the Guddee; but Captain Welsh did
not penetrate into the Muttuck country. The next Rajah, Kumalepur,
raised two corps of Hindoostanees, armed and disciplined in the English
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>fashion, and ordered them to undertake the
conquest of Muttuck; but although successful in some degree, they were
unable to obtain permanent possession, owing to the harassing mode of
warfare pursued by the Bursenaputtee, who retired to his fastnesses.
However, the struggle was at length terminated by his agreeing to pay
an annual tribute in the shape of elephants, Moongah silk, &amp;c. It
is asserted by the Assamese at Rungpore and Jorehath that, at this
period, the Bursenaputtee agreed to pay a tribute of 10,000 rupees; but
that chief positively denied this to the Political Agent, and it is
believed there is no record in existence of such a sum, or even part of
it, being paid: though the acknowledgment of the Rajah of Assam is
undeniable. As regards the Muttucks, the statements of the people
connected with the late Court of Assam, and the followers of Doorga
throughout the province, ought to be received with a great deal of
caution; for both classes are animated by a bitter spirit of hatred,
occasioned by the twofold conquest and plunder of their capital; and
the temporary triumph of a rival sectarian party still rankles in their
minds.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult to ascertain what was the precise status
of the Bursenaputtee in the distracted reigns <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>of
Chunderkant and Poorunder Sing. It is said that the usual tribute was
paid, but this is denied by the other party; we presume, therefore,
that in these weak and divided times the Muttucks were nearly
independent. When the Burmese invaded the country, the Bursenaputtee,
at their requisition, afforded them supplies in labour and provisions,
but no aid in troops or money; and they, therefore, made no attempt to
seize his possessions. On the conquest of Assam by the British
Government, the Bursenaputtee acknowledged its supremacy, and bound
himself to obey its orders; he further engaged to supply three hundred
soldiers in time of war, no tribute having been demanded of him. The
interior management of his territory was left in his own hands,
excepting as regarded cases of murder and other capital offences, which
were to be made over for trial to the Agent of the Governor-General or
Political Agent in Upper Assam. This arrangement had evidently in view
the impressing a rude people with a greater regard for human life,
which the more rigid investigation and sanctity of British forms of
justice might be expected to create. This state of things subsisted
until January 1835, when, under the instructions of the Agent to the
Governor-General, the obligation to supply troops <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>was
commuted into an annual payment of 1800 rupees. No census has been
taken of the population, but from the best information it is estimated
at sixty thousand or seventy thousand persons. It yields a revenue of
20,000 rupees per annum.</p>
<p class="par">In his personal manners the late Bursenaputtee Malebur
was plain and straightforward, and accustomed to think and act for
himself. In his political character, his fidelity was much doubted a
few years back, but he was always found ready to answer every call; as
evinced in the expedition against the Duffa Guam in 1835, and the
Singphoo Luttora chief in 1838, which proved that he was faithful to
his engagement. But his communications with British officers were not
always carried on in the smoothest manner. Accustomed to act as an
independent chief for forty or fifty years, and his territory being
unoccupied by troops, either Burmese or British, he was naturally
independent and blunt in his manners; which bearing, combining with the
testiness of age and dislike of innovation natural to that period of
life, occasionally gave rise to improprieties of expression and seeming
acts of disobedience. He departed this life in January 1839, leaving
ten sons, five daughters, and three widows; and, pending the final
orders of Government, Muttuck <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105"
href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>was placed under Bhageerut
Majoo Gohain, the second son of the late chief: the Bor Gohain, or
eldest son, having waved his claim of birth in compliance with the
wishes of his father.</p>
<p class="par">On the 4th of August 1839, the Political Agent was
directed to confer on the Majoo Gohain the title of Bursenaputtee, and
the management of Lower Muttuck, on his agreeing to the conditions
offered for his acceptance. These were based on the settlement entered
into with his late father, but a new census was required to determine
the amount of tribute to be paid. These terms also withheld Upper
Muttuck, until an amicable understanding could be come to between the
chiefs of that part of the country; who, with their spiritual head, the
Tiphook Muhunt, were averse to the rule of the family of the late
chief. This party being only 1000, or 1500, out of a population of
60,000, it seemed hard to sever them from the jurisdiction of the
Bursenaputtee, without any specific acts of oppression having been
committed by the late chief or his family. The real objection rested on
religious grounds: they are the disciples of a Gosain or priest
professing different religious tenets from those of the
Bursenaputtee&rsquo;s family; consequently they preferred a ruler of
their own persuasion, although they had not experienced <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>any
persecution from the late Bursenaputtee.</p>
<p class="par">In November 1839, the Political Agent arrived at
Rungagora, the capital of Muttuck, and having assembled the principal
members of the late chief&rsquo;s family, and head men of the district,
made known to them the resolution of Government. The Majoo Gohain
Bhagerut and his brothers, finding that Upper Muttuck was not at once
to be included in the settlement, peremptorily refused to accept of the
management of the country; the whole of Muttuck was therefore annexed
to the district of Luckimpoor, and pensions in money and land, to the
amount of 7637 rupees per annum, were granted for the support of the
members of the late chief&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p class="par">Thus terminated the independence of the Muttucks, a
rude, fanatical, stiff-necked people. Accustomed to a very slight
assessment, tendered to their chief in the shape of presents for
settling their disputes, and exercising a considerable share in their
own government, it was feared they would not readily submit to the
heavier rate of taxation for the purposes of good government under
British rule; but these apprehensions, it seems, were unfounded, since,
for the last four years, no resort to force has been found necessary to
compel taxation, or to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href=
"#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span>further any other measures for
their general welfare.</p>
<p class="par">Husbandry is the chief occupation of the Muttucks; and
their district possessing a fine fertile soil and abounding in
extensive rice plains, intersected by large tracts of tree and grass
jungle, expectations are entertained that, in the course of time, this
country will prove a prosperous and valuable acquisition; if
improvements are not impeded by the inroads of border tribes. Two corps
of local Assam Light Infantry, and a company of local Artillery are
ever vigilantly occupied in promptly suppressing combinations or
insurrections raised with a view to the acquisition of plunder and
slaves from our subjects; and there is, therefore, little fear of any
organized obstruction to improvement.</p>
<p class="par">The tea plant is indigenous in Muttuck, and the Assam
Tea Company have cultivated many gardens, greatly to the benefit of
Upper Assam; and if the company steadily prosecute the speculation,
thousands of labourers will, in the course of time, resort thither for
employment, and become permanent settlers. Tea, it is believed, may be
grown in sufficient quantity to supply the English market, and afford a
handsome remuneration to the speculators. An inconsiderate expenditure
of capital placed the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href=
"#pb108" name="pb108">108</a>]</span>Assam Tea Company in great
jeopardy, and at one time it was feared the scheme would be abandoned.
The number of managers and assistants appointed by the Assam Company to
carry on their affairs, and superintend their tea gardens on large
salaries, was quite unnecessary: one or two experienced European
superintendents to direct the native establishment would have answered
every purpose. A vast number of Coolies (or labourers) were induced to
proceed to Upper Assam, on high wages, to cultivate the gardens; but
bad arrangements having been made to supply them with proper wholesome
food, many were seized with sickness. On their arrival at the
tea-plantations, in the midst of high and dense tree jungle, numbers
absconded, and others met an untimely end. The rice served out to the
Coolies from the Assam Tea Company&rsquo;s store rooms, was so bad as
not to be fit to be given to elephants, much less to human beings. The
loss of these labourers, who had been conveyed to Upper Assam at a
great expense, deprived the company of the means of cultivating so
great an extent of country as would otherwise have been ensured; for
the scanty population of Upper Assam offered no means of replacing the
deficiency of hands. Another importation of labourers seems desirable,
to facilitate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name=
"pb109">109</a>]</span>and accomplish an undertaking formed under most
auspicious circumstances. Nor was the improvidence of the Company in
respect to labourers the only instance of their mismanagement. Although
the Company must have known that they had no real use or necessity for
a steamer, a huge vessel was nevertheless purchased, and frequently
sent up and down the Burrampooter river from Calcutta; carrying little
else than a few thousand rupees for the payment of their establishment
in Upper Assam, which might have been transmitted through native
bankers, and have saved the Company a most lavish and unprofitable
expenditure of capital.</p>
<p class="par">It is generally understood that too little attention had
been paid to the advice of Major Jenkins, the Governor-General&rsquo;s
Agent; or more vigilant supervision, better economy, and greater
success might not unreasonably have been expected. The
<i>cultivation</i> of tea in Assam, with a view of supplying the
English market, was, it must be admitted, first contemplated by Major
Jenkins; and for his exertions in having been the main cause of the
Assam plant being proved to be the genuine tea of China, the
Agricultural Society of Calcutta presented him with a gold medal; but
the Assam tea was first <i>discovered</i> by Mr. Bruce in 1826,
<span class="sc">A.D<span class="corr" id="xd24e1682" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The tea of Assam is now becoming better known in the
English market, and its quality more generally appreciated; and as the
chief difficulties have been surmounted, every well-wisher of England
and India must hope the directors will, in future, pursue a more
scrutinizing and economical course: extending the cultivation of tea,
and thereby, while enhancing the profits derivable from the concern,
contribute to render England independent of China as far as tea is
concerned. If Assam tea can be grown equal to the produce of China,
there is little doubt but that, at the rate of one and sixpence the
pound, a remunerating profit will accrue to the Company: a handsome,
but not a too ample compensation for an enterprise involving such
highly important considerations.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The first of these three classes reside on the
loftiest and most remote mountains north of the valley of Assam. The
second class on a lower range, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111"
href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>the third at the foot of, or
on the plains immediately leading up to, the hills. Several parties of
Abors visited me frequently at Saikwah to barter a few fowls, eggs,
ginger, chillies, yams, &amp;c., for salt, and other necessaries of
life. They appear to be descendants of the Tartar race; and are large,
uncouth, athletic, fierce-looking, dirty fellows. The hair of the women
is cut short, like that of the men: in a circle round the crown of the
head it is two inches long, but the hair in front and behind, below the
upper circle, is only about half an inch long. The ears of the men and
women are perforated, the aperture, one inch in diameter, being
distended by a piece of wood, worn as an ornament; and the necks of the
Abor women are loaded with innumerable glass bead necklaces of all
colours. Their arms are likewise adorned, from the wrist to the elbow
with brass rings; the legs are exposed from the knee downwards, the
calf of the leg being bandaged with cane rings to the ankle. The Abors
are feared and respected by all the neighbouring tribes for their
martial spirit; nevertheless they are in great dread of the highland or
Bor Abors, who are said to be as brave as they are savage. Like all the
hill tribes of Assam, the Abors are void of beards: invariably plucking
them, and leaving only scanty moustaches. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>They can neither read
nor write, and their language sounds extremely harsh. The dress of the
Abor chiefs consists of Thibetian woollen cloaks, and a simple piece of
cotton cloth, about a foot square, which is passed between the legs and
suspended by a string round the waist: but not so effectually as to
screen their persons from exposure every time they sit down. Of
delicacy, however, the Abors are as void as they are of cleanliness.
They wear three kinds of helmets, one of plain cane, and others trimmed
with an edging of bear&rsquo;s skin, or covered with a thick yellow
skin of a species of deer. A more formidable looking covering for the
head could scarcely be worn.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In December, 1835, an Abor chief, with two hundred
followers, descended from the hills, and begged permission to locate on
the Dehing, within a day&rsquo;s journey of Suddeah. The Political
Agent asked the chief whether he was aware that the land in that
quarter was within the Company&rsquo;s jurisdiction, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>and
that settlers necessarily became subject to our police administration?
He replied he was aware of that, and would readily give up any of his
people guilty of criminal offences, but demurred to the introduction of
our police officers for the apprehension of offenders. He was then
asked whether he and his people would agree to pay taxes? His answer
was that they had never been accustomed to do so, and could not submit
to it.</p>
<p class="par">From various reports, the Abors are deemed a very rude,
barbarous people, but of open manners and warlike habits; their
bluntness of expression is more manly and pleasing than the base
servility and sycophancy of the Assamese. As they have been accustomed
to levy contributions from the inhabitants of Seesee, and other
districts in Assam, they would be dangerous neighbours, if located in
the immediate vicinity of the Suddeah people.</p>
<p class="par">Not acceding to the terms on which we were disposed to
acquiesce in their application, the Abors returned to their hills.
Scarcity of the means of subsistence was, it is supposed, the cause of
their visit; and they evidently meditated replacing the Merees, who
formerly laboured for the Abors on the Dehong quarter, but have since
emigrated to Upper and Lower Assam, to escape the exactions of that
tribe. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">It appears that the Abors are not allowed to emigrate to
Assam; for in 1844 two young men having eloped with two damsels to
Saikwah, and the latter claiming protection from the British
authorities, an inquiry was made as to the cause of their deserting
their own country; when one freely confessed that her father had given
her in marriage to an old man, but preferring a young Abor, she had
determined on living with him in the Company&rsquo;s territory and
disobeying her father&rsquo;s commands. The other stated that she had
been given in marriage to a young man, who died, and she was retained
for his younger brother, a mere boy; but not being disposed to wait
until he had reached the age of puberty, she had fallen in love with an
Abor youth, and trusted they might be permitted to pass their days in
peace in the forests adjoining Saikwah. If their prayer was not
granted, the girls affirmed, in the most earnest manner, that they
should be tortured and sold to another tribe; while their young
husbands would be cast into the Dehong river with their hands bound, to
suffer death by drowning.</p>
<p class="par">To the present day, little is known of the Abor country,
Europeans never having been permitted to penetrate any very great
distance into the interior. The eminent astronomer and adventurous
traveller, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>Lieutenant Wilcox, in 1827, endeavoured to
ascend the Dehong river, with the view of proving that this stream was
the celebrated Sampoo river; but after a few days&rsquo; journey he met
with insuperable difficulties, from the rapidity of the current, the
closeness of the country, and the absolute prohibition of the Abors
against his proceeding farther. Since that period, no strenuous
endeavours have been made to acquire further information regarding
these rude barbarians. The Merees speak the Abor language, and a
friendly intercourse exists between the tribes; though the Merees have
ceased to bear the yoke of slavery or be subordinate to the Abors.
Their chief occupation is husbandry, and they are generally considered
a quiet and tolerably industrious race.</p>

<p class="par first">The Mishmee tribe reside in the hills on the
north-east extremity of the valley of Assam. They are divided into
several distinct clans. The Dibong Mishmees are called Chool Kutta or
Crop-haired, and the others are known by the appellation of Tains and
Mezhoos. They are a very wild, roaming <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

constantly engaged in petty wars amongst themselves and their
neighbours, the Abors and Singphoos, when the most remorseless
reprisals and massacres are committed. They have no written language,
and appear to belong to the Tartar race. They are of diminutive
stature, but stout, active, and hardy; very dirty in their persons, and
little encumbered with clothing. The chiefs wear the coarse red
coloured woollens of Thibet, and the dress of the lower orders is
extremely scanty. The women, however, are more decently attired;
wearing a striped or coloured petticoat, or cloth folded round the
waist, extending to the knees, and a kind of jacket or bodice, with a
profusion of necklaces of several pounds weight, composed of porcelain,
glass, and pieces of cornelian. The hair is bound up in a knot on the
crown of the head, with a thin band of silver passing round the
forehead. The lobe of the ears is hideously distended to an inch in
diameter, to admit of the silver ear-ring being inserted: this
mutilation of the ear evidently having been gradually effected from
early youth. The Mishmees are not restricted in their number of wives;
each man taking as many as he can afford to support. A curious custom
is said to prevail as a preventive to the constant bickerings and
jealousies natural to this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=
"#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>system; each wife either has a
separate house or store room, or she lives with her relations.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">The Mishmees, women and children, as well as men, are
inordinately fond of smoking; and use a roughly-made Singphoo bamboo
pipe, or a brass China-made bowl, with a bamboo tube. A bag made of
monkey&rsquo;s skin is suspended from a belt for the express purpose of
carrying the tobacco pipe, flint and steel, with a leather case
containing tinder. The men wear a long, straight sword, of China
manufacture, ornamented with a tuft of coloured hair; and a lance,
manufactured by themselves, is constantly carried. They also use the
cross-bow and poisoned arrows. Their head dresses are composed of dog
skin, fastened under the chin by strings. Like all savages, they are
superstitious; invoking an unknown spirit supposed to reside in the
inaccessible mountains or dense forests; and on being afflicted
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>by famine, sickness, or other misfortunes, they
invariably sacrifice fowls and pigs, that the evil may be removed, and
the wrath of the invisible spirit appeased by their offerings and
submission. We are led to believe that the authority of the chiefs,
though respected, is not absolute: they are obliged to abide by the
decisions of the people, duly assembled for the purpose of settling
disputes and arranging the amount of amercements to be imposed for
offences committed. For all heinous crimes remission is said to be
procurable by the liquidation of a fine; but adultery, if the husband
be not privy to the offence, is punished by death, which is inflicted
by the people purposely assembled for the trial.</p>
<p class="par">The Mishmees, like the Abors, are most skilful in the
construction of cane bridges; which they throw across rivers of eighty
yards breadth. Three large cane ropes are sufficient to pass a person
over in safety; but the transit, to any but a Mishmee, would be
impracticable: for few would hazard the risk of falling into a rapid
river below, or of being suspended midway on these ropes, unable to
retire or advance. Accidents, however, rarely occur, and the Mishmees
cross over their rivers in this manner without difficulty or
apprehension.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1836, it was said that the Mezhoo
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>and Tain, or Digaroo Mishmees had a serious
quarrel about a marriage: for though at enmity often times with each
other, and speaking a different dialect, they have not been debarred
from intermarrying. Blows having been exchanged, the Mezhoo chief
Rooling determined on speedily overcoming his enemies by an
overwhelming force, and for this purpose he invited the Lamas to come
to his assistance; which they did, and entered the Mishmee country with
a force of seventy men, armed with matchlocks. The Tain Mishmees were
totally defeated by the Lamas and Mezhoo Mishmees, and lost about
twenty men. After this success, the Lamas returned to their own country
about September 1836, and from that day we have had no similar invasion
of this portion of Assam in favour of the Mezhoo Mishmees. No precise
information is obtainable as to where these hostile operations
occurred; but the conflict evidently took place several days&rsquo;
journey in advance of the villages visited by Lieutenant Wilcox in
1826&ndash;27, and by Dr. Griffiths in 1836&ndash;37. However, such was
the heart-burning or feud between the Tains and the Mezhoos in
1836&ndash;37, that the late Dr. Griffiths, in his visit to the Mishmee
country, could not by promises or bribes induce the Tains to furnish
him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>with guides, even to the nearest village of the
Mezhoos, or there can be little doubt that he would have succeeded in
making good his way into the Lama country. In justification of their
conduct, the Tains remarked, &ldquo;If we give you guides, who is to
protect us from the vengeance of the Mezhoos when you are gone? and who
is to insure us from a second invasion of the Lamas?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Mishmee tribes were formerly obedient to the Assam
Governors, the Suddeah Khawa Gohains: if they were not totally
dependent, they at least gave small presents as tokens of submission,
and attended to the orders of the Khamtees and Singphoos. In 1835, for
example, the Duffa Gaum received considerable assistance from gangs of
Mishmees sent down to erect his stockades. If under any pretence,
therefore, the Thibetians, being a branch of the Chinese empire, should
be permitted to establish their supremacy over the hill tribes in
allegiance to the British Government in this quarter of the valley, our
interests would be affected; but in the present rude state of society
in this region there is little to be apprehended on this score. An
immense, desolate, almost impassable tract, intervenes, so as to render
ingress or egress from Assam to Thibet impracticable, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>excepting at certain seasons of the year.
Traversing such a country, when the route follows the course of rivers,
must naturally be difficult in the extreme. The hills are invariably
characterized by excessive steepness, and as the greater portion of the
route winds round them at some height above their bases, marching is
excessively fatiguing, difficult, and dangerous. In many places a false
step would be attended with fatal consequences: precipices must be
crossed at a height of a hundred feet above the foaming bed of a river,
the only support of the traveller being derived from the roots and
stumps of trees and shrubs, and the angular character of the face of
the rock. The paths are of the very worst description; always
excessively narrow and overgrown by jungle in all directions. In very
steep places the descent is often assisted by hanging canes, which
afford good support, but no attempt is ever made to clear the paths of
any obstruction: in fact, the natives seem to think the more difficult
they are, the greater is their security against foreign invasions.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding these impediments to a free intercourse,
some little trade, it is supposed, is carried on between the Mishmees
and Lamas; the Mishmees exchanging their Bih (poison), Gathewan (an
odoriferous <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>root), Manjeet (madder), and Teetah (a bitter
root, greatly esteemed for its medicinal qualities) for Lama cattle,
brass pipes, gongs, and copper vessels; and if a friendly feeling of
confidence could be established between the people of the plains of
Assam and the Lamas, it is impossible to calculate to what extent the
commerce between the two nations might attain. Once every year in the
cold weather, that is between November and March, the Mishmees visit
Suddeah for the purpose of bartering the only export produce of their
country: namely, bih, teetah, manjeet, gathewan, gongs, brass pipes,
and copper vessels; in exchange for which they invariably take, in
preference to English merchandize, cows, buffaloes, and a quantity of
small, coloured beads. Their cultivation is scanty: apparently not
sufficient to supply their wants, and is, moreover, carried on in a
very rude way. The ground selected as most favourable for cultivation
lies on the slopes of hills, or on the more level patches occasionally
bordering rivers. Some villages produce a good sort of hill rice, but
their chief cultivation is ghoom dhan (or Indian corn), konee dhan, and
two or three other inferior grains. The villages situated at low
elevations produce excellent yams and aloos of several kinds. They are
not acquainted with wheat, barley, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>&amp;c., nor have they taken
the trouble to grow potatoes, but that esculent is obtainable at
Suddeah in great abundance. Of opium, a small quantity is cultivated,
chiefly for sale to the Singphoos; though many of the natives are great
opium-eaters. A small quantity of inferior cotton is also cultivated
for the manufacture of their own clothing, and tobacco is in great
request among them; they are likewise very fond of spirituous
liquors.</p>
<p class="par">We have no authentic data whereby to judge of the amount
of the population, but from the following rough census of the followers
of a few chiefs, it would not appear to be extensive.</p>

<p class="par">The number of villages among which the above population
is distributed, is seven; but there are two other villages, Muresas and
Roolings, close to Khoshas. By far the greater number of villages
appear to be located near the banks of the Lohit; one only has been
observed on the Lung. The villages of Jengsha, Japan, Deeling, and Yeu,
consist of several houses each; neither, however, exceeding ten in
number. Ghalooms, Khoshas, and Primsong, consist each of a single
house, capable of containing from eighty to one hundred and sixty
persons. These comprehensive residences are divided by bamboo
partitions into twenty or more rooms, all opening into a passage, in
which the skulls of animals killed during the possessors&rsquo;
lifetime are duly arranged. The houses are all built on raised
platforms, and the roofs are formed of the leaf of the arrow-root
plant, or the leaves of cane, which are found in great abundance in all
the forests. Khosha&rsquo;s house is one hundred and sixty feet in
length; each room possessing a fire hearth; but as there are no
chimneys, or any outlet for the smoke, excepting the door, a Mishmee
dwelling is scarcely endurable.</p>
<p class="par">Of Mishmee habits and customs little is known; feuds and
misunderstandings having hitherto obstructed a freedom of intercourse
indispensable to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>the acquirement of correct information.
Several European officers have visited the Mishmee country for a few
days, and have been desirous of proceeding by this route over the
mountains north into the Lama country, or Thibet; to ascertain whether
the celebrated Sampoo river flows into the Burrampooter from this
quarter, or debouches into the Dehong, below Suddeah, or takes its
course, as has been surmised, through China. This interesting inquiry,
however, has not yet been solved; though little or no doubt appears to
exist that the Sampoo joins the Burrampooter at one of these points.
The British Government have hitherto, from prudential motives,
abstained from giving offence to or exciting the jealousy of the
Chinese, by permitting any of our officers to attempt to enter Thibet
from the extreme north-eastern quarter of the valley of Assam. This is
a sacrifice of geographical knowledge to policy; for there can be no
question that a scientific traveller would obtain much information
respecting the character of the country, and bring us acquainted with a
people at present unknown to the civilized world. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Dooaneahs are descendants of Burmese or
Singphoo fathers, from Assamese women, captured in predatory irruptions
and kept as slaves. Assamese males, also carried off into slavery, are,
from the loss of caste by their connection with the Singphoos, and the
adoption of Singphoo habits, denominated Dooaneahs. They are a very
hardy race, and inhabit the densest jungles; cultivating scarcely
sufficient rice and opium for their maintenance, and subsisting, when
their stock of grain is expended, on yams, kutchoos, and other roots of
the forests. Without the aid of the Dooaneahs, no military detachment
could move to many parts of the frontier, for none are so expert as
pioneers. With the Dhao, or Singphoo short sword, they will cut a
footpath through the densest jungles in the most expeditious manner,
thus enabling our troops to move almost in any direction. They are not
endowed with a martial spirit, and it is said they will not stand the
fire of musketry; but if properly trained and disciplined, their fears
might be surmounted. Their addiction, however, to opium is so great,
that no permanent reliance could ever be placed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>in
them as soldiers, in any emergency; and being utterly despised by their
former masters, the Singphoos (from whose thraldom they have only
lately escaped) it would seem inexpedient to place them in situations
of trust, where the possibility of betrayal or defeat could be
anticipated. The loss of their services as slaves, in cultivating the
land, is deeply felt by the Singphoos; but these latter have not yet
known the full extent of their inconvenience. In course of time few
Dooaneah slaves will remain attached to the Singphoos; who must
consequently either resort to manual labour themselves, or starve, or
leave the province: which, by the way, would be the greatest boon we
could desire, for the safety and improvement of our peaceable
subjects.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The province of Assam was invaded about 1224
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, by a band of Ahoom or Shan adventurers;
who conquered the country, parcelled out its territory, and subjected
the population to a vassalage approximating to that in force under the
feudal system of Europe. By this arrangement the whole body of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>cultivators were divided into different
portions, called Khels, varying from one thousand to five thousand
cultivators each. They were governed by officers of various grades:
those called Borahs, possessing authority over twenty ghoots or sixty
paicks; Sykeahs, over one hundred ghoots or three hundred paicks; and
Huzarees, over one thousand; with one superior officer denominated a
Kheldar, who was generally a nobleman, or person connected with the
royal family. But in recent times this arrangement has been modified,
and Borahs, Sykeahs, and Hazarees have exercised authority over a much
smaller number of persons. The Kheldars collected the revenue and
exercised jurisdiction in petty criminal offences. Owing to the
backward state of society in Assam, and its almost utter destitution of
commerce and manufactures, the revenue was seldom paid in money, but
mostly in personal labour: all public buildings, roads, bridges,
&amp;c., were constructed out of the funds of labour at the command of
the Government; and the services of all public functionaries, clerical,
medical, military, and judicial, were paid in the same manner. To
facilitate this arrangement, the community were divided into threes,
(or in some parts of Assam fours) each division being called a ghote;
and if one of the three served the state throughout the year,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>the other two were excused the payment of money,
revenue, or produce. From <span class="corr" id="xd24e1848" title=
"Source: artizans">artisans</span> and manufacturers, who were
subjected to a higher taxation than other classes, money was taken
occasionally; but more frequently the tax was levied in produce.</p>
<p class="par">Under the Ahoom Government the monopoly of office was at
first confined to the Ahooms, or original conquerors of the soil; but
in the reign of Rodroo Sing, 1695, <span class="sc">A.D.</span>, when
the Assamese natives of the soil had become proselytes to the Hindoo
religion, they were admitted to a share in the public employ. When the
British Government conquered the country in 1825, this system of
revenue, founded upon personal labour, was still in existence; but a
money rate of taxation under the form of a poll-tax was introduced as
far as circumstances would allow, the rates being fixed with reference
to the customs of the ancient government. The two poorahs of land
allowed to each cultivator were deemed equivalent to two English acres:
the land could not be taken from him as long as he paid his revenue,
but it was nevertheless considered the property of the state and could
not be disposed of by the tenant. Almost the whole of the land in Assam
is now taxed according to its quality, at so much per poorah or acre,
but in some places any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href=
"#pb130" name="pb130">130</a>]</span>quantity of land may be cultivated
by paying a certain sum per plough. The poll tax is likewise collected
where the population is unsettled and scanty.</p>
<p class="par">The religious wants of the people were provided for by
the Assam rulers apportioning a certain number of paicks or cultivators
to each Shuster or temple, for the support of which one-half of their
revenue was assigned: the other half was appropriated by Government.
Independently of this, grants of land were made to various religious
persons, under the title of Debootur (service of the Gods), Dhurmooter
(religious purposes), and Bramooter, for the support of the Brahmins
(or priests); and a remission of half the usual rate of taxation was
allowed when the claims of the parties were fairly established.</p>
<p class="par">Assam is noted for the abundance of gold found in many
of its rivers; and as the manner of acquiring it by washing the sands
may not be generally known, and is a subject of considerable
importance, a description may not be uninteresting to the reader. In
the first place, the gold washer, taught by experience, chooses a
favourable site; a wooden trough, six feet long by one and a half broad
and two inches and a half deep, is then placed on pegs driven into the
sand: one end of the trough being raised to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>throw it into an inclined or sloping position.
This effected, a shifting bamboo sieve, made to fit the trough, is
placed upon it; two men with baskets then strew a plentiful coat of
sand and gravel from the river on the sieve, through which the gold
washer quickly washes the sand by pouring water on it, and shaking the
sieve to hasten the descent of the water into the trough. By this means
the heavier particles sink and the lighter are carried off by the
stream, that continues to flow from the square or upper end of the
trough to the circular end, from which it escapes by an aperture
purposely bored. The coarse gravel on the sieve is frequently removed,
and a fresh supply is continually heaped up, until the sand in the
bottom of the trough containing the gold is about an inch thick. The
sieve is then removed, and placed at one end of the trough, and a
quantity of water being poured through the sieve, it falls on the sand
like a shower of rain, till all the light particles are carried off by
the stream flowing down the trough. By this process the heavier
particles only remain, and these are gold dust and iron. The gold dust
being now distinctly visible, is subjected to a further washing, and
then dexterously floated on to leaves; after which it is transferred to
a glazed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>earthen vessel, and again washed with the hand.
The gold washer now daubs his hands with lime, and having applied some
quicksilver and water, again washes the sand with his hands, which
causes a scum to rise on the surface; this being cleared off, after
repeated washings, the gold is found adhering to the quicksilver, when
it is taken from shell to shell till every particle of sand is removed.
The quicksilver and gold dust are then placed in a shell on a charcoal
fire, and with the aid of a bamboo blow-pipe the ore is speedily
melted; a little water being then applied, the gold is separated and
forms a ball at the bottom of the shell. It is considered a good return
if three persons at one trough can obtain four annas weight of gold
(worth three rupees) in twelve days: giving the labourer one anna four
pice per diem. At one time there was a numerous body of gold washers
employed in collecting gold from many of the rivers in Upper and
Central Assam; and the rivers were, in some instances, let by
Government to persons wishing to enjoy the sole monopoly of bringing
gold into the market. The profit on the gold dust must have been very
considerable, seeing that it realized from twelve to fifteen rupees per
tolah, and was produced in large quantities. But, like many other
monopolies, this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133"
name="pb133">133</a>]</span>was found open to abuse: the people were
oppressed for the benefit of the manufacturers, and the Government
deemed it expedient to discontinue it as a source of revenue; thus
leaving one of the most valuable products of the province neglected.
Gold, in consequence, is becoming scarce; and we hope, therefore, that
the evil will work its own cure, by stimulating the gold washers to
resume their ancient lucrative vocation.</p>
<p class="par">In many parts of the province, coal of a good quality,
is found; and indeed the soil of Assam generally may be considered
extremely rich: it abounds in valuable products, such as rice,
sugar-cane, moongah silk, pepper, mustard-seed, and cotton. But the
bounty of nature is marred by the indolence and apathy of man: the
cultivator seldom looks beyond his immediate wants, and makes no
attempt to improve his condition. In fact, in agricultural, commercial,
and manufacturing industry, this country may be considered at least a
century behind Bengal; and there seems little prospect of improvement,
excepting by the introduction of a more active and industrious people,
who might stimulate the natives to increased exertions. An inveterate
indulgence in the use of opium by the population at large, is the curse
of the country: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134"
name="pb134">134</a>]</span>depressing the industry and withering the
physical energies of the people, by limiting their desires to the
gratification of the wants of the day.</p>
<p class="par">The greater portion of the Assamese are Hindoos; but
they are very lax in their observance of the rites of the Hindoo
religion, and in the few ceremonies which they do perform, deviate
considerably from the strict tenets enjoined by that creed. In their
domestic habits they are simple in the extreme; their poverty and
ignorance limiting their desires within the narrowest compass. A slight
cotton covering thrown over the shoulders, and a dhoti or sheet tied
round the waist, reaching to the knees, forms the chief clothing of the
poor: shoes are never worn. A little oil, rice, vegetables (such as
greens and chillies), seasoned with the smallest quantity of salt, and
sometimes a few small fish, compose the humble fare of the poor
peasant. These necessaries are procurable for about three shillings per
mensem, and as the wages of a day labourer or coolie are from one and a
half to two annas per diem, or about two rupees per mensem, he has
still one shilling to spare<span class="corr" id="xd24e1874" title=

<p class="par">This spare diet has, of course, its influence upon the
stature and bulk of the Assamese; who are, consequently, slender,
effeminate, and indolent. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=

numbers being very fair, and as many excessively dark. Their morals are
exceedingly depraved, and their manners servile and contemptible. Nor
are the women one whit superior to the men; and although they are far
from possessing attractive persons, they are utter slaves to the worst
licentiousness.</p>
<p class="par">The dwellings of the Assamese are of the meanest
description imaginable: there are no stone or brick houses<a class=
"noteref" id="xd24e1894src" href="#xd24e1894" name="xd24e1894src">4</a>
in the country; a simple hut, ten feet by twenty, divided into a couple
of rooms for sleeping and sitting in, or not uncommonly one solitary
room, form the only accommodation a man, wife, and family possess. The
hut is about ten feet high, with a grass roof, and the walls are made
of reeds plastered outside, and sometimes inside also, with mud and
cow-dung. A small platform of bamboos, two feet high, serves as a
bedstead; and a seetulpattee, or grass mat, constitutes the amount of
bedding, without any other covering than the clothes that are worn
during the day. Many Assamese, however, prefer the bare ground, with a
simple mat as a bed. The earth floor is daily plastered with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name=
"pb136">136</a>]</span>mud and cow-dung: the cow being held sacred
amongst the Hindoos, its ordure has, it is considered, the peculiar
property of not only cleansing, but purifying their habitations. Its
use certainly gives their huts a tidy appearance, and worms and insects
are not so troublesome as they would otherwise be.</p>
<p class="par">These frail buildings require yearly repairs, but the
peasants are put to no expense for them, except in bringing posts,
reeds, and grass from the jungle. Assamese families of respectability
and wealth live in larger houses of the same character of architecture;
but instead of one hut, they erect several close together, in the form
of a square, each hut opening into the quadrangular court-yard, which
is entered by a portico or receiving room for visitors.</p>
<p class="par">In the estimation of the Assamese, marriage is one of
the most important duties of life; not only for the additional comfort,
assistance, and respectability it confers on the man, but because he
considers he has not fulfilled the divine will if he has failed to take
unto himself a wife&mdash;and sometimes a plurality of wives. Polygamy
is prevalent throughout the province, and is only limited in extent by
the means of each man to provide for the support of his wives. If a man
marries only one or two <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href=
"#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>wives, he probably has on his
establishment three or four concubines; and his life is therefore
embittered and harassed by perpetual family quarrels. It is the custom
in Assam for parents to make early arrangements for the marriage of
their sons; and having selected the daughter of any particular family
of the same caste, a regular agreement is entered into for the amount
of the dower to be paid to the parents of the girl, even when she is
but a mere child. The first ceremony of betrothing the girl is called
Tamul pankatta, or partaking of the betel nut and leaf of the betel
vine; which takes place when the damsel may be about four years of age.
The parents of the youth proceed to the house of the family with whom
they wish to form a matrimonial alliance, make their proposal, and
produce a present of the following articles:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">The bridegroom is kept awake all night by feasting,
dancing, and singing; and in the morning, all having broken their fast,
the bridegroom accompanies his bride to his own dwelling in a regular
procession. Drums, cymbals, and gongs take the lead; the bride follows
either in a palkee, or mounted on a pony; or, if very poor, she walks
in the midst of her female acquaintances, covered from head to foot
with a white cotton cloth or veil thrown loosely over her; and the
bridegroom and his friends bring up the rear. On arrival at the
bridegroom&rsquo;s house, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href=
"#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>his friends partake of a repast,
and return to their homes in the course of the afternoon. The young
couple then take up their abode, generally in a newly erected house
adjoining their parents&rsquo; dwelling. The whole expense of the
marriage conducted on this scale amounts to sixty-five rupees fourteen
annas; but only the better orders disburse such a sum. If the parties
are in very affluent circumstances, however, many hundreds of rupees
are expended. The poorer class, from inability to incur further outlay,
are not unfrequently married at the second ceremony of Nowae toolun for
four or five rupees, including every expense.</p>
<p class="par">Should the parents of the girl, contrary to the marriage
contract or betrothment, give their daughter to another person, it is
incumbent on them to refund the value of the presents they may have
received on different occasions for a number of years previously. Yet
in few countries, probably, will the number of violated contracts or
promises of marriages be found to exceed those of Assam. The litigation
and ill-will consequent on these ill-advised agreements is
incalculable, and the complaints under this head in the civil courts
are innumerable.</p>
<p class="par">There is a remarkable similarity between one of the
customs in Assam and that practised by <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>the Patriarchs of
old. Jacob served Laban as a servant or bondsman many years to obtain
in marriage Leah and Rachel, who were sisters; and he was not allowed
to marry the younger before the elder. So in Assam a man may marry two
sisters, but he must marry the elder before the younger. It is not
uncommon, when a man is poverty stricken, to engage to live and work
for several years for the father of the girl he wishes to marry. He is
then called a Chapunea, a kind of bondsman, and is entitled to receive
bhat kupper, food and clothing, but no wages; and at the expiration of
the period of servitude, if the girl does not dislike him, the marriage
takes place. The man is looked on in the family as a khanu damad (or
son-in-law), and is treated kindly. If the girl&rsquo;s father be very
wealthy, and he has no sons, he will sometimes select, from some
equally respectable family, a husband for his daughter, and bring him
up in his own house. The youth so selected is likewise called a
Chapunea, and inherits the whole of his father-in-law&rsquo;s property.
If a woman&rsquo;s husband dies, though she may be only eighteen or
twenty years of age, she can never marry again. She is considered a
Baree, or widow for life; but very few women&mdash;if any&mdash;so
circumstanced lead a life of celibacy: they prefer submitting
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>to be selected as companions, and are then
contemptuously designated batuloo (refuse or offal). And this condition
of existence among the lower orders is almost as common as marriage;
for the becoming a man&rsquo;s Dhemuna stree (alias mistress or
companion) involves no expense for bhar bhete (marriage present) or
gaodhun (dower), and is therefore more convenient. The offspring of
this connection inherit all the rights of legitimate issue, and are not
the less respected in society; there is, therefore, no bar to the loose
and immoral habits so prevalent among the poorer classes in Assam. The
indulgence of these is further facilitated by the ease with which the
marriage-tie may be dissevered. No reference is necessary to either the
temporal or ecclesiastical courts: dissolution is simply effected by
the husband, if displeased with his wife or doubtful of her fidelity.
On these occasions he merely assembles his friends, and in their
presence addresses his wife in these words:&mdash;&ldquo;Henceforth I
look on you as my mother and sister;&rdquo; and tearing a betel leaf
into two pieces the marriage is dissolved, and the man and woman are
free to select fresh partners. The divorce is equally complete if the
husband distributes a little salt to each member of the assembly of
friends, making the same speech to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb144" href="#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>wife. The Cacharies,
a simple-minded, honest, and industrious tribe of Assamese, cut off a
branch of the kuddum tree before a select body of friends, when the
husband declares he has divorced his wife, and the ceremony is
completed.</p>
<p class="par">The funeral obsequies of the Assamese are performed
agreeably to Hindoo usages. The body is burnt as soon as possible after
death. Jogees, Weavers, and Cacharies bury their dead in the same
manner as Moossulmans. A curious practice prevails amongst the Assamese
of giving salt to their friends assembled to bear witness to many of
the common occurrences of life. If a man adopts a son, he distributes
salt to his friends in token of a person having been appointed to
succeed to his property. If he buys a piece of land or purchases a
slave, or if a dispute is settled by arbitrators, salt is in like
manner distributed amongst a few friends who testify to the fairness of
the transaction; and amongst themselves these agreements or settlements
are as binding as laws could make them.</p>
<p class="par">When an Assamese has been excommunicated by the priests
for any civil offence, the expiation of his crime and his restoration
to society are effected by the payment of a fine, called chundrayen,
amounting to four rupees: dhurmdund (twelve annas), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>feeding the Punchayet or jury, (one rupee) at
most about six rupees. If the offender be very poor, one rupee ten
annas will suffice to pay for &ldquo;purachit&rdquo; (absolution);
which is granted by the priest.</p>
<p class="par">By the ancient Assam laws, slavery existed in a variety
of forms. All born of a free slave by a free father, as well as those
of pure slave parentage, were considered slaves. Free women married to
slaves became, with their offspring, slaves. The king had the power to
grant to his nobles and spiritual advisers portions of the free
population as slaves, which the owner could dispose of in any manner he
thought proper: they were designated Bohoteahs. Prisoners of war were
often granted to individuals as slaves; and criminals who had a
sentence of death passed upon them had it commuted to slavery, and were
assigned to certain masters. The free people were at liberty to
mortgage themselves for debts; remaining in bondage for a number of
years or until the sum borrowed was paid off; and as the debtor was
seldom in a situation to liquidate his obligation, he continued a slave
to his creditor for the remainder of his life. In each district the
value of slaves varied considerably. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p class="par">Rajeswur Singh, and Luckme Singh. The third son, Mohun
Burjona Gohain, being marked with the small-pox, was incapacitated to
reign; and his younger brother, Rajeswur Singh, superseded him. By the
evil machinations of the Bor Borowa, Rajeswur Singh was led to believe
his brother, Mohun Burjona Gohain, was plotting against his government;
and for the effectual suppression of this conspiracy, his brother was
expelled the capital in the most ignominious manner, his ears having
been slit and one of his eyes plucked out. It was, doubtless, as we
have already remarked, from this severity that the prince Mohun Burjona
Gohain, in the succeeding reign of his younger brother, Luckme Singh,
was induced to rebel against his sovereign, and to join the Muttucks,
hoping thereby to avenge his wrongs and gain the throne; but though
temporary success attended the Muttuck insurrection, the Prince failed
in realizing his ambitious projects, and hastened the extinction of the
power of the Ahoom dynasty.</p>
<p class="par">In no part of the world, perhaps, have such sanguinary
customs and laws prevailed as in Assam, under the Ahoom kings. Many of
their punishments were revolting to humanity. Criminals were whipped,
put in the pillory, impaled; their limbs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

ears, and lips mutilated; the hair was torn out by the roots, eyes were
plucked out of the sockets, and sometimes offenders were ground between
wooden rollers, sawn asunder, or tortured with red-hot irons. A variety
of other cruelties were practised with a relentlessness that but too
vividly marked the barbarity of the rulers of those days, and rendered
it a matter of sincere congratulation that a merciful providence
shortened the period of their sovereignty, and placed the country in
the hands of the British Government, in 1824&ndash;25.</p>

<p class="par first">The south-eastern hills of Assam are the abode of
many tribes of Nagas. They are a very uncivilized race, with dark
complexions, athletic sinewy frames, hideously wild and ugly visages:
their faces and bodies being <span class="corr" id="xd24e2541" title=
"Source: tattoed">tattooed</span> in a most frightful manner by
pricking the juice of the bela nut into the skin in a variety of
fantastic figures. They are reckless of human life; treacherously
murdering their neighbours often without provocation, or at best for a
trivial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>cause of offence. The greater number of the
Nagas are supposed to be in a very destitute state, living almost
without clothing of any kind. Their poverty renders them remarkably
free from any prejudices in respect of diet: they will eat cows, dogs,
cats, vermin, and even reptiles, and are very fond of intoxicating
liquors.</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Amongst a people so thoroughly primitive, and so
independent of religious prepossessions, we might reasonably expect
missionary zeal would be most successful; for the last eight years,
however, two or three American Baptist missionaries have in vain
endeavoured to awake in them a sense of the saving virtues of
Christianity. For a considerable period the residence of the
missionaries was at Suddeah; where their labours, I believe, were
unattended by any conversions either of Assamese or Singphoos. On the
station being deserted by the troops for Saikwah, in 1839, the
missionaries turned their attention more particularly towards the
Nagas; they took up their residence on the Boree Dehing river, at
Jeypore, established a school, and were indefatigable in endeavouring
to gain some correct knowledge of the savage tribes in their vicinity.
A few years&rsquo; experience here proved the futility of their plans.
Instead of wandering amongst the savage tribes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>scattered over an immense extent of country, in
unhealthy, dense jungles, it would have been prudent and politic to
have afforded instruction in the first instance to the populous
villages in the plains. One or more natives have been baptized at
Jeypore, agreeably to the rites of the Baptist persuasion, by immersion
in the Boree Dehing river, and this is the sum total of the missionary
success. This has, it is understood, induced them to change their abode
to Seebsauger and Nowgong, where they seem to think there is a greater
chance of their succeeding. The missionaries have a printing press, and
many elementary books of instruction in Assamese and English have been
printed by them for the use of the natives. Their exemplary conduct and
exertions merit the utmost commendation, and it is to be deplored that
their well-intentioned labours should not be crowned by felicitous
results.</p>
<p class="par">To this day little is known either of the country
inhabited by the Nagas, or of their habits and customs. Several
officers have penetrated a considerable distance into the hills
occupied by the Nagas; but always with marked and necessary caution,
attended by a military guard. Greater intercourse between the highland
Nagas and the people of the plains were much to be wished; but it is
doubtful if any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152"
name="pb152">152</a>]</span>advantage would accrue to the British
Government from extending its sway southward, over immense tracts of
unprofitable wastes or dense jungles thinly inhabited.</p>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">Naga Government.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Under the ancient Assam Government some of the
tribes may have been more dependent upon the Government than they are
now, but the Naga territory was never considered an integral portion of
the sovereignty of Assam. It is customary with the Naga tribe to offer
trifling presents to the British authorities, as a mark of submission,
and something is given in return, in token of amicable feeling; but the
Nagas have never been considered subject to our regular jurisdiction,
and nothing in the shape of an assessment has ever been imposed upon
them.</p>
<p class="par">It is very difficult to arrive at anything like a
correct understanding of the nature of the feuds between neighbouring
tribes; for the Nagas have no written language, and their dialects vary
considerably in different parts of the country. No general government
exists over the whole tribe: they are divided into innumerable clans,
independent of each other, and possessing no power beyond the limits of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>their respective territories. Each tribe seems
ever jealous of its neighbour; and cruel hostilities, ending in the
most tragical manner&mdash;even to the extermination of a tribe and the
total destruction of its cattle, stores, and property&mdash;are often
the result of their mutual animosity. The form of the Naga government
is democratical; each clan seems to be ruled by a president and two
subordinates or deputies, who form the executive. The president is
called Khonbao, and the deputies Sundekae and Khonsae: the one prime
minister, and the latter a chief over twenty houses. The chief
magistrate or arbitrator, the Khonbao, decides all disputes of a civil
or criminal nature, and it is optional with him either to direct or
enforce his orders with his own sword; but in all this he is merely the
organ or agent of the people, for the decisions are the results of the
consultations of the whole Raj, or populace, who discuss all matters of
importance in the open Moorung, or hall of justice, to be found in
every Naga village. The Khonbao, Sundekae, and Khonsae, on these
occasions, summon all the community to attend and assist with their
counsel in disposing of any affairs of moment: such as a war to be
undertaken against a foe, or in furtherance of revenge; or the
punishment of crimes committed by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>any of the members of the
tribe in opposition to their established polity.</p>
<p class="par">The dignity of Khonbao is hereditary: the eldest son of
the incumbent invariably succeeding to the title and authority. No
junior brother can assume the rank, under any pretensions founded on
greater ability, personal appearance, or reputation of valour. In the
event of the Khonbao leaving no progeny, his wife succeeds to his title
and authority; and the deputy Khonbao, Sundekae and Khonsae in council
enforce her commands, and report everything to her connected with the
welfare of the community.</p>
<p class="par">No hospitality is shown to a stranger visiting the Naga
country, unless he visits the Khonbao in the first instance: he is
unable, even under the greatest distress, to obtain shelter or
provision elsewhere. On the arrival of an embassy it is conducted to
the residence of the Khonbao, who gives audience immediately, and
returns a reply by the messengers on his own responsibility, if the
object of the visit is of no great importance. But, on the other hand,
should the embassy be for the purpose of obtaining redress of wrongs
committed by the clan of the Khonbao, the embassy is retained and
entertained hospitably till the Sundekae, Khonsae, and principal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>elders of the people can be assembled in the
moorung; when the grievance is stated and inquiries made, each member
stating openly and candidly his opinion on the matter at issue. The
Khonbao propounds what is, in his opinion, expedient and best for the
public good; but if there appears any irregularity, the people express
their disapprobation to the Khonbao, and he is constrained to abide by
the will of the community, to give orders to the embassy, and allow its
departure to the place whence it came. In this manner all affairs and
discussions are regulated amongst the Nagas. Any attempt to travel
through their country, unaccompanied by a person acquainted with the
roads, villages, and Naga language, would be the height of folly; as
the traveller would not be supplied with water, food, or fire, neither
would any shelter be afforded him, and his life would be in imminent
danger.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">Omens.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The superstition of the Nagas is strikingly
exhibited in the great attention paid by them to all signs of good and
evil, before they attempt the execution of any project: whether it be
to prepare the land to receive the seed, to proceed on hunting or
fishing excursions, or to enter upon any war <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>expedition. On these occasions the Khonbao,
Sundekae, and Khonsae, assemble the people, and a grand consultation is
held between the chief ruler and the elders of the village, in order to
divine the most auspicious moment, and to ascertain whether the affair
under consideration will turn out favourably or otherwise. To aid the
deliberation, new-laid eggs are procured, which they address in these
terms:&mdash;&ldquo;Oh eggs, you are enjoined to speak the truth and
not to mislead us by false representations.&rdquo; The eggs are then
perforated and roasted on a fire, and the yolk is minutely examined: if
it appears entire, the omen is considered good; if broken, the reverse,
and auspicious for their enemies. In this conclusion the senate are
likewise confirmed by a peculiar appearance of the white of the egg.
Another simple mode of divining the propriety or expediency of carrying
out certain plans is by burning the Bujjal bamboo. Should it crackle
and fall out of the fire on the left side, it is a good omen; should it
fly out on the right, the event is accepted as a warning of failure and
disaster. By these simple and strange proceedings are the acts of these
people guided. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=

</div>

<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">Husbandry.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In their agricultural operations, the implements
of the Nagas are simple and rude in the extreme; but bullocks and
buffaloes are used as in Assam. At the commencement of the season, the
Khonbao having assembled the people after the usual ceremonies of
consulting the omens, the land is apportioned out to each clan, the
jungle is cleared, and sowing commences. Konee dhan, a small grain, and
Indian corn, or goom dhan, is sown in January and gathered in about
June, when the Behoo is celebrated with great festivities; resembling
the old English custom of harvest-home. After the goom dhan and konee
dhan is cut, ahoo dhan is sown; and after this crop, kuchoos, a kind of
root resembling the arrow root, are planted; so that in the course of
the year three crops are raised from the same land. This is done for
three successive years; when, the land being impoverished, new land is
broken up for the same period, until the usual time of fallow admits of
the old land being again resumed. Yet, with all the means of avoiding
famine, blessed with a fertile soil and a wonderful rapidity of
vegetation, so improvident <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href=
"#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>are these savages, that in a few
months the whole produce of the land is consumed, and they are
compelled to subsist on roots and leaves of the forests till the return
of harvest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">Salt Wells.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In different parts of the Naga territory many salt
wells exist, and being worked by some of the tribes an immense quantity
of salt is produced. This is sold or bartered to the people of Assam
for rice, and by this means, doubtless, the miseries attendant on a
scanty supply of food are greatly lessened. We have no means of judging
of the extent of the salt trade between the Assamese and Nagas, but the
commerce might doubtless be increased by greater vigilance, to the
mutual advantage of both parties.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div3 section">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main"><span class="sc">Preparations for War.</span></h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the Nagas purpose taking vengeance on a
neighbouring tribe, the Khonbao assembles the elders of the village;
and, in accordance with established customs, the omens being consulted
and proving propitious, a plan to cut up their enemies by surprise is
decided on. Each man provides himself with a spear, sword, bamboo
choong, a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name=
"pb159">159</a>]</span>hollow joint of the bamboo filled with water,
and a small basket of rice; and, the party being formed, set out in the
day towards the frontier of the enemy who is to be attacked. At night
they cross over and occupy a favourable position in ambush, surrounding
the enemy&rsquo;s village. There they take their repast, and when the
cock first crows on the following morning, they rush, with great
shouting, into the village, and cut up every body they meet with;
sparing neither old infirm men, nor helpless women, nor children: even
the cows, pigs, and poultry of the foe are slaughtered. Sometimes the
victors remain on the spot two or three days, but generally return to
their own village on the same day; taking with them the heads, hands,
and feet of those they have massacred: these they parade about from
house to house, accompanied with drums and gongs, throwing liquor and
rice on the heads, and uttering all manner of incantations: saying,
&ldquo;Call your father, mother, and relations to come here and join
you in eating rice and drinking spirits, when we will kill them with
the same sword.&rdquo; They then sing, dance, and perform all manner of
anticks; pierce and mangle the heads of their enemies, and again with
curses enjoin them to summon their whole race to suffer the same
ignominious treatment. In the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>massacre, one of the Nagas
may have, perhaps, particularly distinguished himself by evincing great
ferocity in cutting off more heads than any of his party; which
circumstance he fails not to bring to the notice of his assembled
friends. Stalking out before them he challenges them to mark his deeds,
and with many songs of boisterous mirth and audacious boasting, he
drags the heads of his enemies about in the most contemptuous manner,
proclaiming his own triumph somewhat after this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;In the world I am the most powerful and
courageous; there is none equal to me. I am the greatest of all men. No
one&rdquo; (pointing to the skulls of his enemies) &ldquo;can perform
such deeds. Like to the clouds that thunder and hurl down fire-balls
into the water to the destruction of the fish,&mdash;like to the tiger
who leaps out to seize the deer,&mdash;like to the hawk who pounces
down on the chickens and carries them off, do I cut up every one, and
carry off their heads; and with these weapons&rdquo; (dashing them
together, to produce a clashing noise) &ldquo;I have killed such and
such persons: yes, I have killed them. You know my name. The greatest
beast of the forest, the elephant, I first destroy, and after that all
other animals too insignificant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>to mention. Such a hero am I,
there is no one equal to me,&rdquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p class="par">The same scene is enacted for three or four successive
days; when the heads being hacked and sufficiently danced about to
satiate Naga revenge, they are suspended from the branches of Nahor
trees. After this, the ceremony of tattooing the body is performed, and
a most severe operation it is. The burnt ashes of a pot are pricked
into the skin with the thorns of the cane: a great quantity of blood
exudes, and the body swells to a great size. Being previously thrown
into a state of stupid intoxication, the patient is left to welter in
the dirt and blood for three days, unconscious of his condition. After
this operation, the young sprouts of the Bhat-teeta tree being well
pounded, are smeared over the wounds, and in the course of twenty-five
days the patient is able to resume his avocations; upon which a number
of pigs and fowls are killed, and a great feast is given; the heads of
the enemies being brought down from the trees and strewed out upon a
platform before the populace in the court, or Raj Moorung. For a whole
month from the day of the massacre, the Nagas daily sing the war song
quoted above, and dance and manifest the greatest excitement and
delight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">All villages are not entitled to the honour of retaining
the heads of their enemies; they must be kept in the village of the
Khonbao.</p>
<p class="par">In some Naga villages it is the custom, for a man who
has committed murder in cutting off the head of a foreigner, to be
joined by ten or a dozen Nagas in submitting to the operation of
tattooing; which in such cases is an indispensable ceremony. The
tattooing is pricked round the calves of the legs in ten or twelve
rings or circles interspersed with dots; the thighs, the breast, the
neck, the fingers, the back of the hand, the arms, the forehead, and
nose, the vicinity of the eyes and the ears being similarly decorated.
The poorest Naga peasant deems it an honour to have his body thus
embellished with stripes, figures, and dots; and the omission of the
ceremony would entail on him eternal disgrace and censure. Indeed, the
tattooing determines the character and consequence of the individual;
for by certain marks on one arm it is apparent that he has killed a
man; when both arms and body are scarred he is known to have murdered
two individuals; and when the face and eye-sockets are indelibly
impressed with the tattoo, he stands proclaimed the assassin of three
of his fellow-creatures, and is thenceforth esteemed a valiant warrior.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">On the question being once put to the Nagas whether they
would like to become the subjects of the Company, they promptly
replied,&mdash;&ldquo;No: we could not then cut off the heads of men
and attain renown as warriors, bearing the honourable marks of our
valour on our bodies and faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">If a Naga happens to be suddenly surprised, and cut off
by the inhabitants of a neighbouring village, his corpse is quickly
taken up by his friends and placed on a platform in the jungles near
the road. At the expiration of three or four days they perform some
ceremonies, and wait till a favourable opportunity occurs for avenging
his death. The purpose is never relinquished, though its execution may
unavoidably be tardy: by day and night they lie in ambush in the
jungle, or on the plains near the roads, till they can pounce upon some
unwary individual of the enemy. His murder is then communicated to his
friends in a singular way. Forty or fifty Nagas, armed with wooden
clubs, strike a large hollow piece of wood called a tomkhong, from
which a loud, terrific sound proceeds, which gives token to the enemy
that one of their tribe has died in acquittance of the debt of revenge.
To such an extent does this vindictive spirit prevail, that the Nagas
will wait for two or three generations devising <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>plans for decapitating a member of a tribe who
has murdered one of their clan; and when the opportunity of vengeance
offers, they are sure to take advantage of it, regardless of the
personal innocence of the man whom they select as the victim of their
fury. The death of the victim is hailed with dance and song, and the
liveliest demonstrations of joy: even the old men, women, and children
seem in raptures at the announcement of the joyful tidings that their
tribe has succeeded in taking revenge.</p>

the infant is shorn off, and the parents perform several ceremonies,
inviting all their friends to a grand feast, on which occasion the

to her back, and whilst at work the infant is placed on the ground.
When the child is about a year old it is left at home in the village,
and the parents pursue their avocations unattended by their little

but, with all the youths of the village, takes up his abode at the
Moorung, a large building set apart for this especial purpose. The
parents, however, still continue to provide him with food, and he is
obedient to their will, assisting them in cultivating their fields. He
carries a sword and spear, and wears the Naga habiliments. At fifteen
or sixteen years of age he begins to be dissatisfied with his existence
in the Moorung, and makes arrangements for taking a wife; generally
selecting a cousin, the daughter of his mother&rsquo;s brother. On
these occasions the parents collect as much rice and liquor, and as
many cows and buffaloes, as their means will admit. The girls all live
together, like the boys, in a separate Moorung or house allotted for
them; sometimes they reside in a house in which a corpse is kept,
probably from the greater sanctity such an inmate would confer on their
habitation. The youth is not restricted from visiting the damsel of his
choice, and he adopts a well understood stratagem to ascertain her
sentiments regarding himself. Whilst he is talking to her companion, he
carelessly puts down his pipe, and narrowly watches her actions. If the
damsel entertains any regard for him she instantly takes up his pipe
and smokes it; from that moment the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>youth is satisfied of
his conquest, and hastens to communicate the result to his parents, who
arrange matters with the girl&rsquo;s relatives. Presents of ornaments
are sent for the girl, which she immediately wears; and an offering of
liquor and tumbool pan (or betel nut leaf) to chew, being accepted by
her parents, the marriage is decided on. After this, cows, buffaloes,
rice, and liquor are forwarded to the house of the intended bride, and
all her relations and friends are invited to a grand feast. An old
Deodhunee (or priestess) accompanies the youth to the party with a
basket of ginger, and the youth then addresses the chosen damsel,
thus:&mdash;&ldquo;This day I take you to be my wife. I will not desert
you, neither will I take another; eat this ginger in pledge
thereof&mdash;henceforth we are husband and wife.&rdquo; The woman on
this eats a bit of the ginger, and then the youth sits down; whereupon
the girl, in the same strain, taking up a piece of ginger,
says&mdash;&ldquo;I am your wife, and you are my husband, and I will
obey you as such. I will not take another husband, for we are husband
and wife; in token of which you will eat this ginger.&rdquo; The
marriage ceremony being thus concluded, the youth, after partaking of
the feast, returns home to his parents, and in the evening his wife
joins him with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>baskets of food for her husband&rsquo;s parents
and his brothers&rsquo; wives. She thenceforth resides with her
husband. From that day the husband ceases to abide at the Moorung, and
after the lapse of two or three days, according to the village roll,
takes his tour of guard duty at the Moorung. From the day of his
marriage he commences the preparation of a separate house, upon the
completion of which, in a few months, he quits the parental roof. Some
Nagas will, however, continue to cultivate the land, and share the
produce of their labour with those of their parents; but on the birth
of a child the families separate.</p>
<p class="par">Amongst the Nagas, marriage is contracted with near
relatives, such as cousins, in preference to other women. A widow,
having no children, cannot marry a stranger, but must marry her late
husband&rsquo;s brother; and if he happens to be a mere boy, she will
still live with him as his wife; nor can the boy take another damsel:
he <i>must</i> marry his brother&rsquo;s widow. The custom is one of
great antiquity, and apparently cannot be infringed. If the widow has
one or two children she cannot marry again, but must remain in her own
house. No Naga marries more than one wife, and if she dies he is at
liberty to marry again.</p>
<p class="par">The crimes of adultery and seduction are treated
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>with the utmost severity: the offenders are
brought before the Khonbao and the people assembled to investigate the
offence; on proof of which, the Khonbao, or his Ticklah, decapitates
the man in a conspicuous part of the road, between two or three
villages; or he is tied with cane cords to a tree and there crucified.
In some clans it is the practice to deprive both the seducer and
seduced of their lives; in others, the former is placed in a basket,
his hands and feet tied together, and he is rolled many times from the
summit of a hill until life be extinct.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Nagas consider sudden death as particularly
unfortunate: even if a person dies after one or two months&rsquo;
sickness, the period is still deemed too short to be lucky; and his
corpse is instantly removed and placed in the jungles on a platform
four or five feet high, where it is left to decay. For three or four
days after a death, the relatives do not leave the village; neither do
other villagers resort to the village in which death has occurred
during the same period. If a person dies who has been afflicted with a
long illness, a platform is raised within his house, and the corpse
being folded in clothes is placed thereon. By night and day the corpse
is watched with great care, and as soon as it begins to decompose,
large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>quantities of spirituous liquor are thrown over
it; and whatever the deceased was in the habit of eating and drinking
in his lifetime (such as rice, vegetables, and liquor) is placed once a
month on the ground before the body. The virtues of the deceased are
frequently rehearsed; the heirs and relatives throw themselves on the
earth, and make great lamentations for many months after the death has
occurred. At the expiration of the period of mourning, a great feast of
liquor, rice, buffaloes&rsquo; and cows&rsquo; flesh is prepared by the
survivors; and an immense number of people, armed with their swords and
spears, and dressed in the most fantastical garb, as if preparing for a
war expedition, are assembled to partake of it. They commence the
festival by repeating the name of the deceased, singing many kinds of
songs, dancing and cursing the deity or spirit in these words:
&ldquo;If to-day we could see you, we would with these swords and
spears kill you. Yes, we would eat your flesh! yes, we would drink your
blood! yes, we would burn your bones in the fire! You have slain our
relative. Where have you fled to? Why did you kill our friend? Show
yourself now, and we shall see what your strength is. Come
quickly,&mdash;to-day, and we shall see you with our eyes, and with our
swords cut you in pieces, and eat you raw. Let us see <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name="pb170">170</a>]</span>how
sharp your sword is, and with it we will kill you. Look at our spears,
see how sharp they are: with them we will spear you. Whither now art
thou fled? Than thou, spirit, who destroyest our friends in our
absence, we have no greater enemy. Where are you now?&mdash;whither
hast thou fled?&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">With these and similar speeches and songs, they clash
their swords and weapons together, dance, and eat and drink throughout
the night. On the following day the corpse is folded up in a cloth and
placed on a new platform four or five feet high; and the whole of his
weapons, swords, spears, panjees choonga (hollow bamboo joint, for
holding water), rice-dish,&mdash;in fact everything used by the
deceased in his lifetime, is now arranged round his bier, which is held
sacred: no one would dare to touch a single thing thus consecrated.
After this ceremony is concluded, the whole of the party disperse to
their respective homes.</p>
<p class="par">On the death of the Namsungea Khonbao, who, it is said,
was one hundred and twenty years of age, his corpse was removed in
December 1843, and according to an ancient custom, a tusk elephant was
purchased from the Muttuck Bur Gohain, and killed, with three hundred
buffaloes and pigs; when the Nagas enjoyed a magnificent feast. The
usual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>practice of reviling the deity, while singing
and dancing, was kept up with uncommon fervor, and the bacchanalian
scene has perhaps seldom been exceeded. The heads of the slaughtered
animals were suspended round the platform within a large enclosure, and
the corpse was strewed over with an abundant supply of all kinds of
forest flowers.</p>
<p class="par">Theft is held in great abhorrence amongst the Nagas, and
is consequently so rare that they leave everything exposed in the open
fields. If any person is detected in committing the offence no mercy is
shown: the Khonbao pronounces sentence of decapitation without a
moment&rsquo;s hesitation. The Nagas are remarkable for simplicity,
candour, and integrity; even the comparatively small vice of lying, to
which the natives of British India are so seriously and universally
addicted, is unknown among them, and will probably continue so until
they have been corrupted by their more enlightened neighbours, the
Assamese, or by the advance of civilization, refined arts, and manners.
The Nagas have no names for the days of the week, and know not their
own ages. Summer and winter are the only divisions of the year they
recognise, distinguishing them as dry and wet seasons of six
months&rsquo; each. Time is counted by the moon, or by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=
"pb172">172</a>]</span>number of crops they can recollect reaping. They
believe in a God or Spirit called Rungkuttuck Rung, who created the
earth and all things, but they have no hope of future rewards, nor any
fear of punishment hereafter; neither do they believe in a future state
of existence.</p>
<p class="par">For the above information we are indebted to Bhog Chund,
who is the son of a West Countryman of the Khetree caste, by an
Assamese mother, and having lived many years amongst the Nagas, is
thoroughly acquainted with them. He is now a resident and industrious
cultivator in the plains. He reads and writes Assamese, and is a most
straightforward character. He would be an invaluable companion and
guide in travelling through the Naga territory.</p>
<p class="par">I do not vouch for the correctness of the list of the
Naga tribe inserted in a later page, but in the absence of more
authentic details, it may be deemed worthy of consideration. The
present account of the tribes is confined to the Nagas of Upper Assam;
but it is supposed that very similar customs and habits prevail amongst
those of central Assam. The Nagas bordering immediately on the plains
are, for the most part, amicably disposed towards the British
Government; and those on the Patkoe range have shown <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>a
desire for our protection against the marauding Singphoos. The Nagas
residing on the hills most remote from the valley are said to be fine,
stout, athletic men, of fair complexions; and unencumbered with the
smallest strip of covering in the shape of clothing for any part of the
body.</p>
<p class="par">In 1842&ndash;43, the Namsangea, Bordoareah, and
Borkhoormah Nagas invited a party of the Khetree to visit them as
friends, but when they got them into their power they treacherously
massacred twenty-four persons. Thageng, one of the Khetree party, being
only wounded, fled and communicated the catastrophe to his tribe, who
at the sight of his wounds prepared for revenge; and in a short time
they were successful against the Nagas. The Khetrees, being ignorant of
the Assamese language, were unable to pass through the territory of
their enemies to report their grievances to the British authorities at
Jeypoor. They accordingly went to Tomkhoomana, and lying in ambush,
surprised and cut off the heads of twelve men of the Borkhoormah tribe,
in revenge for the murdered of their own tribe. Upon this the civil
authorities proceeded to the village of the Khetrees to endeavour to
put a stop to these atrocious assassinations, but unfortunately the
Namsangea and Bordoareah Nagas, contrary to strict <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>injunctions, persisted in following in the wake
of the British embassy of peace. The Khetrees perceiving the advance of
their enemies, placed in the road a small basket of ginger kuchoos and
a spear, as a token of submission to the British Government, but loudly
protested from the summit of their hills against a visit being made to
their village; dreading, as they did, the vengeance of the Namsangea
and Bordoareah Nagas. The interpreter, Bhog Chund, who accompanied the
party, entreated the Khetrees to remain quiet in their village, and to
listen to terms of peace; but they indignantly rejected the offer, and
threw down stones, and discharged a volley of spears, upon the
advancing embassy. This being returned by a few rounds of musketry in
self-defence, the Khetrees fled from their village to the neighbouring
inaccessible hill fastnesses. The Namsangea and Bordoareah Nagas
perceiving this, instantly rushed into the deserted village,
slaughtered all the cows, pigs, and fowls, and burnt every house to the
ground. After this untoward event a retreat was necessary, for the
Khetrees came upon the party, throwing down stones and spears from
their hills. A Sepahee having loitered in the rear, was speared to
death, and his head and hands cut off and triumphantly stuck up on
bamboos: the head in the village of Najoo, and the hands in Khoekting.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>After some difficulty the little detachment was
extricated from its perilous position, and retreated in safety. Shortly
after this lamentable affair, a larger military detachment was sent
out; but to the present time an amicable settlement has been
impracticable. Almost immediately after the last expedition, the
Khetrees cut off the heads of eight men of the village of Bulatin; from
which we may infer that their animosity continues unappeased, and that
there is little hope of these savages being speedily brought to a sense
of the advantages attending a reconciliation. Our intercession might be
effectual for a time; but it is more than probable that it would be
incompatible with a Naga&rsquo;s sense of honour to forego his greatest
delight&mdash;revenge.</p>
<p class="par">From the figured statement obtained from native
authority, it would appear that there are one hundred and four Naga
villages in Upper Assam, containing eleven thousand and ninety-five
houses, with a population of forty-eight thousand five hundred and
eighty-eight persons; but this estimate is probably erroneous. We shall
perhaps be nearer the truth, if, assuming the number of houses to be
correctly stated, we allow three persons for every dwelling: this gives
a census of thirty-three thousand two hundred and eighty-five
souls&mdash;a closer approximation to the apparent population.

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">GARROWS.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of all the hill tribes bordering on the Assam
valley, north or south, the Garrows near Goalparah, though not lofty in
stature, are endowed with the most powerful herculean frames. The
expression of their countenances is savage, and their complexion
exceedingly black. In conversation they are loud, and remarkable for
asperity. Passing through Lookee Dooar to the Jeypore stockade, at the
foot of the Garrow hills, I met with many Garrows who reside on the low
hills bordering Assam, and learned that they were frequently in great
danger from the highland Garrows; who, feeling secure in their mountain
fastnesses, made occasional incursions into the territory of the
former, and committed acts of violence upon the British subjects
located in the plains.</p>
<p class="par">A savage custom exists amongst the Garrows, of
commemorating the death of their relatives by massacring our
inoffensive subjects whenever they can do so with impunity; whether in
open day, in ambush, or by a sudden night attack in overwhelming
numbers. In this respect they resemble other tribes of which we have
already treated. At their festive meetings it is said the Garrows are
guilty of great <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180"
name="pb180">180</a>]</span>excesses in imbibing spirituous liquors. A
dried excavated gourd, which does duty for a bottle, and holds about
one quart and a half, is filled with an intoxicating liquor distilled
from rice: this, at their jovial parties, is presented to each person,
whose nose being seized, the gourd is applied to the mouth till the
individual is perfectly satiated, or falls prostrate in a fit of
intoxication. After this, the toper is immersed in a pool of water, or
the river, that the temperature of the body may be cooled. In the
choice of food few things come amiss to a Garrow palate. For example, a
dog fed with rice and then roasted alive, is esteemed one of the most
exquisite dainties. Every description of meat is consumed, even when
perfectly putrid. Singularly enough, however, milk is considered
unwholesome, and is never drank.</p>
<p class="par">The Garrow women are remarkably coarse and ugly, with
very dark complexions. They wear scarcely any articles of cloth
covering, but, in common with most savages, they are particularly fond
of showy ornaments. Their necks are adorned with a profusion of
coloured glass beads; and if the lobe of the ear can only be distended
to the shoulders by the weight of ear-rings, they consider that they
have succeeded in rendering themselves peculiarly attractive.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>The Garrows to this day are independent of our
rule, and are, therefore, free from any tax on their cultivation.</p>
<p class="par">An immense quantity of cotton is grown on their hills.
This, until 1843, was subject to a tax paid by the purchaser to
Government, at the market, where the Garrows bring down their cotton
for sale; but, owing to the mal-practices of the native collectors
appointed to receive the customs, little profit accrued to Government
after the expenses of the establishment had been paid. For the
encouragement of trade and a freer intercourse with our people, the
customs have lately been entirely abolished; but it is supposed that a
plan for the assessment of the whole of the Garrow cultivation will, if
possible, shortly be adopted. The climate of the Garrow hills, however,
offers a serious obstacle to this measure; for, according to our
present information, no European constitution could endure a lengthened
residence amongst them; and without the constant presence of a British
officer, armed with authority to arrange their affairs, neither the
advancement of civilization, nor the realization of a revenue
sufficient to defray the expense of retaining and settling the country,
could be accomplished. It is supposed that a lac of rupees, or ten
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>thousand pounds sterling, might annually be
raised from the land; but our knowledge of the country and the
resources of the people is so limited, that this estimate cannot be
relied on. Moreover, from the known aversion of the Garrows to any sort
of taxation, the undertaking can only be rendered successful by the
presence of a large body of British troops; to whom the sword, spear,
and poisoned arrows of the savages could offer but little effectual
resistance.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This tribe, although near neighbours of the
Garrows, are unlike them in personal appearance. They are an athletic
race, but by no means fond of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183"
href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>more occupation than will
suffice to give them a bare subsistence. This gained, their lives are
passed in fishing, bird catching, and hunting, merely by way of
pastime. Like all savages, they are untrustworthy.</p>
<p class="par">In the year 1829 at Nuncklow, Lieutenants Beddingfield
and Burlton were, by the Cosseah Rajah&rsquo;s order, barbarously
massacred. A regular war ensued; consequent on which Rajah Teeruth
Singh was deprived of the district of Bur Dooar, and the Rajah of
Pantam having joined the Cosseahs, his district was also sequestrated.
At this period, no protecting force being at hand, the Garrows joined
the Cosseahs and invaded the districts of Bur Dooar and Pantam,
accompanied by the people, who were compelled to join the insurrection.
The movement, however, was quickly suppressed by military detachments.
Since then the Cosseahs have been vigilantly watched by the Sylhet
Light Infantry, stationed at Chirrapoonjie.</p>
<p class="par">In the Cosseah hills a large supply of potatoes is
annually raised and sold in the Gowahatty market, realizing to the
Cosseahs no inconsiderable profit. The effect of this traffic being to
promote a more frequent intercourse with the people of the plains,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>it is hoped that in course of time the Cosseahs
may learn the value of peaceable commercial pursuits, and become a
prosperous and civilized race.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The hills of Bootan, about two hundred and twenty
miles long by ninety broad, form the northern boundary of Assam. The
population of the country, including the Dooars, is assumed at 145,200
souls, the Bootan hills 79,200, and the Dooars or low lands at 66,000;
but this calculation, made by the late Captain Pemberton, has been
proved to be greatly in excess of the truth, as regards the population
of the Dooars. In 1842 a census was taken of five Dooars: namely,
Ghurkola, Banska, Chapagorie, Chapakhamar, and Bijnee, in the Kamroop
district; when it appeared there were about 10,000 inhabitants, and the
net revenue of the tracts amounted to 17,544 rupees 7 ans. 4 pice, or
1,754<i>l.</i> 8<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> It may, therefore, justly be
inferred that the population of the whole of the Dooars would not
exceed 40,000 souls. Captain Pemberton, the British Envoy deputed to
Bootan in 1838, describes the Booteah to be &ldquo;in disposition
naturally excellent; he possesses an equanimity of temper almost
bordering on apathy, and he is seldom sufficiently roused to give vent
to his feelings in any exclamations of pleasure or surprise; on the
other hand, they are indolent to an extreme degree, totally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=
"pb186">186</a>]</span>wanting in energy, illiterate, immoral, and
victims of the most unqualified superstition. The punishment of the
most heinous offences may be evaded by the payment of a fine, which for
murder varies from eighty to two hundred Deba rupees, or 40 to 100
Company&rsquo;s rupees, or from 4<i>l.</i> to 10<i>l.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Polyandry, or plurality of husbands, prevails throughout
Thibet and the northern parts of Bootan; and on the death of the head
of a family his property becomes escheated to the Deba or Dhurma
Rajahs, without the slightest reference to the distress entailed on the
afflicted survivors. &ldquo;The highest officers of state in Bootan are
shameless beggars, liars of the first magnitude, whose most solemnly
pledged words are violated without the slightest hesitation; who enter
into engagements which they have not the most distant intention of
fulfilling; who play the bully and sycophant with equal readiness, and
are apparently totally void of gratitude, exhibiting in their conduct a
rare compound of official pride and presumption with the low cunning of
needy mediocrity; and yet preserving, at the same time, a mild
deportment, and speaking generally in a remarkably low tone of
voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Amongst the officers of the Deba or Dhurma Rajahs of
Bootan, not one appears to have been <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>entitled to the
confidence of the Envoy. The habits of all classes are most
disgustingly filthy, and in the mode of preparing their food little
attention is paid to cleanliness, and still less to the quality of the
meat they consume. On festive occasions they imbibe large draughts of
the liquor called chong, which is procured by fermentation from rice.
&ldquo;The diet of the great body of the people is restricted to the
refuse of wretched crops of unripe wheat and barley, and their food
consists generally of cakes made from these grains very imperfectly
ground; but the food of the Government officers and priests consists of
the flesh of goats, swine, cattle, and rice, imported from the
Dooars.&rdquo; The Dooars are large tracts of country leading up to the
passes into the Bootan mountains. In January, 1842, they were all
appropriated by our Government as a permanent measure; in consequence
of the non-payment of tribute by the Booteahs, their &ldquo;repeated
acts of aggression in the murder and seizure of British subjects, and
likewise for assisting to organize bands of robbers and sharing in the
profits of their plunder.&rdquo; Whether the Bootan hills will furnish
a sufficient support for their scanty population seems problematical;
and if pressed by hunger it is not improbable the Booteahs will rush
down and ravage the fertile plains of Assam. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>The
measure was, however, indispensably necessary to prevent the frequent
recurrence of oppression and systematic plunder of the people located
at the foot of the Bootan mountains. The extensive territory
denominated Dooars has always belonged to the Assam kings, and the
Booteahs invariably paid tribute for the same. Their exactions and
malpractices having imposed on the Government the necessity of
depriving the Booteahs of a charge they were unworthy of retaining,
this cannot be viewed as a harsh proceeding: it was most reluctantly
adopted, and only when it became evident that the finest land in Assam
had been converted into a desolate waste, overgrown with jungle and
nearly depopulated, owing to the arbitrary severity of the Bootan
rulers.</p>
<p class="par">In December, 1842, a friendly meeting took place at
Banska Dooar between the highest officers of the Bootan Government and
the Governor-General&rsquo;s Agent. The Booteahs were attended by about
two hundred followers; and during their few days&rsquo; stay their
complaints were fully entertained, and will probably be satisfied by
the grant of a small annual sum as compensation for the loss they have
sustained in the annexation of the Dooars to Assam.</p>
<p class="par">During the interview the Booteahs were plentifully
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>supplied with swine, the most acceptable gifts
that can be offered to a Booteah; and an officer who was present on the
occasion assured me that the incessant squeaking of the pigs, when
roasting alive by these heartless barbarians, was most distressing, and
the sight of the culinary process excessively disgusting. As soon as
the animals had been partially roasted they were cut up, and, without
any further preparation, re-toasted and speedily consumed.</p>

<p class="par">The Booteah is a large, athletic man, of a dark
complexion, with an unpleasant, heavy, but cunning countenance.
Compared with other hill tribes in their neighbourhood, they are
deficient in spirit and bravery. For example, in March 1836,
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, a party of seventy-five Assam Sebundy
Sipahees proceeded against six hundred Booteahs, who were posted in
five masses, with a few men extended between each, at Soobunkatta, in
Banska Dooar. When the Dewangerie Rajah was requested to retire with
his troops; they answered the requisition with shouts of defiance and a
simultaneous advance. Lieut. Matthews, perceiving the critical
situation in which his little band was placed, instantly advanced to
the contest, and, firing a volley and then gallantly charging with the
bayonet, caused the immediate dispersion of the whole force, leaving on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name=
"pb190">190</a>]</span>the field twenty-five killed and fifty wounded.
The Dewangerie Rajah himself was closely pursued, and only escaped
through the swiftness of the elephant on which he was mounted; his
tent, baggage, robes of state, and standards, fell into the hands of
the victorious Sebundies.</p>

<h3 class="main">SATH BOOTEAH RAJAHS OF KOOREAHPARAH DOOAH, IN
DURRUNG.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Having given a brief outline of the Booteahs of
Banska Dooar in Kamroop, we propose now to detail a few authenticated
facts and incidents connected with the remaining tribes noted above;
who are located in the northern mountains between the Bur Nuddee west
and the Kochoojan east, bordering on the Luckimpore district, north of
the Burrampooter river.</p>
<p class="par">And first commencing from the Bur Nuddee west, we find
the Kalling and Booree Goorma Dooars belonged, for eight months in the
year, to the Booteahs subject to the Tongso Pilo, under the Deba and
Dhurma Rajahs of Bootan; during which time they levied upon the people
contributions, or black mail, in the shape of rice, Erea cloths, and
cattle. During the remaining portion of the year, from the 15th of June
to the 15th of October, the people of the Dooars reverted to the
jurisdiction of the British Government; and for the protection granted
to them they paid an annual revenue, at a certain rate per plough. A
hearth tax was likewise realized. But this double rule was attended
with the most disastrous results. No man under the tyrannical
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>Booteah Government dared evince signs of
affluence, or even of comfort: the people were compelled, for their
self-preservation, to dress in the miserable garb of the lowest Hindoo
peasantry; for the mere suspicion of a person being possessed of any
wealth, entailed on him the strictest espionage, and not unfrequently
the seizure of the whole of his property. Not satisfied with this, if
the slightest idea were entertained that there was money or other
valuable property concealed (for it is the custom of the Assamese to
bury their wealth underground), torture was resorted to without the
slightest compunction, until the unfortunate sufferer confessed to
having a hoard, and surrendered the little savings of a whole life to
his merciless persecutors.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the condition of the inhabitants of the Dooars
till 1838: hundreds annually retreated to the Pergunnahs (districts) of
Assam under British rule, to enjoy the fruit of their labours in peace
and safety. The beautiful, fertile Dooars were then rapidly reverting
to a barren wilderness: fearful exactions and cruel oppressions
rendering the existence of the few remaining communities precarious and
unendurable; until an unlooked for incident occurred to deliver the
people from the thraldom of their demi-savage rulers. Gumbhur
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>Wuzeer having long been suspected by the
Booteahs of disaffection towards them, and of possessing great wealth,
the Tongso Pilo of Bootan, through the Soobah Rajah, gave orders for
his destruction; and in December, 1838, he was barbarously murdered.
The whole of his property, amounting to 50,000 rupees, was confiscated,
and his wives, children, and adherents, in all twelve persons, were
carried away into the hills.</p>
<p class="par">This outrage justly aroused the British Government to
redress the grievances of a long oppressed people. The Dooar was
immediately attached to Assam; and the Booteahs have never, to this
day, sought pecuniary compensation for the loss of their territory. The
son of the late Gumbheer Wuzeer was permitted to return to Assam in
1844, and resume the fiscal charge of his father&rsquo;s villages; and
ere long, probably, the Booteahs of this tract will see the folly of
their past conduct, and be glad to accept such compensation as the
Government may be disposed to make them for the privation of their
power to levy black mail from the people. The annual tribute realized
from Kalling Dooar previous to its annexation, amounted to 390 rupees,
and was collected in the following articles:&mdash; <span class=

<p class="par">The country of Towung being in Kumpa or Thibet, quite
distinct from Bootan, south of the Sampoo river, it appears that a
portion of the Thibet territory, or more properly the Chinese and
British frontiers, are actually in immediate contact in the
Kooreahparah Dooar, about twenty miles from the Burrampooter river.
This Dooar, as we have said, was governed by these chiefs eight months
in every year. During this period, the seven Rajahs paid periodical
visits to the Dooar, and let loose many hundreds of their followers to
range throughout the Dooars, and quarter themselves gratuitously upon
the people: changing from house to house until they had consumed all
the food the poor Ryots had to give them. The Sath Rajahs had usually a
caravan of large herds of ponies, mules, &amp;c., as far as Umerathal,
one march from Oodalgorie. On their arrival there, the inhabitants of
the Dooar were compelled to take care of the cattle, and be in constant
attendance on the Rajahs, furnishing them with supplies of rice,
cloths, spirits, pigs, &amp;c.; and at the approach of the hot months,
the ponies, mules, and donkeys were laden with the whole of the
collections <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>levied from the people of the Dooar, and the
chiefs retreated to the mountains at Nareegooma.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the annual visitation to which the people were
subjected the moment the four months of British rule expired. A gradual
decrease of the population of the Dooar was the natural result of this
tyranny; but the grasping oppression of the Booteahs underwent no
diminution. They made no remission on account of the decay of the
population: the same amount of collections was still drawn from the
remaining Ryots. The country became overgrown with jungle, and the
malaria of these plains was so injurious to the constitutions of
Bengalees or Europeans, that the tract could not be visited with
impunity for above a few weeks in the year. The fevers were most fatal,
and life was frequently extinguished in four or five days. Thieves,
highway robbers, and murderers here sought and found a safe asylum
under the shadow of Booteah rule, by administering to the rapacity of
the chiefs. They surrendered a portion of their ill-gotten wealth in
the shape of fines for the protection given them, in opposition to
treaties and the laws of civilized nations.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the state of affairs, when, to the unspeakable
delight of the inhabitants, the Dooar was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span>attached by the
British Government in 1839. A police thannah was established at
Oodalgorie, British law was enforced, marauders and disturbers of
society were quickly suppressed, and at the present day a prosperous
population has again sprung up; only too thankful that they can enjoy
the produce of the land in peace and safety, under a powerful
Government capable of protecting them from the aggressions and
exactions of the wild mountaineers. The contributions taken in kind
from each house by the Booteahs consisted of five pieces of Moonjah
silk, sar cloth, one piece of Erea cloth, one gumcha or handkerchief,
Moonjah thread, and metal bracelets, worth altogether about one rupee
and a half. Such, at least, was the estimate made by the late Mr. David
Scott, the Agent to the Governor-General. But there can be no doubt
that the Booteahs were in the habit of exacting as much as possible
from the most wealthy in the Dooar, though from the poorest peasant
they might have collected their black mail upon some settled principle.
In this manner the sum annually collected would vary; but we have
reason to believe that 5,499 rs. 15 ans. was the average sum levied on
the Ryots in the shape of contributions in kind, and 411 rs. 13 ans. in
black mail or ready cash. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href=
"#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The Booteahs, it is affirmed, yearly brought down
presents of various articles, such as salt, blankets, &amp;c., which
they gave to the Ryots. These presents were valued at 966 rs. 15 ans.,
which being deducted from the supposed amount of the value of the
contributions above noticed, the Sath Rajahs, it would appear, received
4944 rs. 13 ans. Upon this data, in 1844, a permanent settlement was
made with these chiefs. They agreed to resign all claim or title to
collect black mail in the said Dooar for the future, on condition of
receiving 5000 rs. from the British Government as compensation for the
sacrifice they made. The tribute paid in kind from this Dooar, previous
to its attachment in 1839, amounted to <span class="corr" id=

ans. black mail, exclusive of 416 rs. 8 ans. which was deducted for
collecting the contributions from the Ryots in the shape of food,
clothing, &amp;c.; but in April, 1839, Moodhoo Sykeah, the Patyhery of
Ooorung, having been barbarously murdered by some Booteahs of the
above-named clan, they were from that date a proscribed tribe, and
prevented from deriving any benefit from the Dooar in collecting black
mail. Refusing to give up the murderers, all access to the Dooars was
strictly denied them, and they were justly regarded as unworthy of any
consideration. They frequently denied having any <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name=
"pb201">201</a>]</span>authority over the murderers, pleaded the
hardship of the whole body being made to suffer for the faults of a few
individuals, and expressed their extreme regret at having incurred the
displeasure of the British Government.</p>
<p class="par">Moodhoo Sykeah&rsquo;s fate is supposed to have arisen
from his attachment to the British Government, and the energy displayed
by him in causing the land to be measured, to effect a regular
assessment thereof, in lieu of a plough and capitation tax. Such an
arrangement was particularly repugnant to the Booteahs, as they
imagined it would interfere with the Ryots paying them their black
mail; they therefore took vengeance on the promoters of this measure,
and Moodhoo Sykeah was cruelly cut to pieces in his own house by
Booteahs partaking of his hospitality. Gumbheer Wuzeer had been
similarly treated the year before, under suspicion of too great an
attachment to the British Government, and a desire to carry out their
views. In 1844 the chiefs were permitted to visit Tezpore, and in
consideration of the contrition evinced by them, and the uncertainty as
to whether the murderers were still in existence, and really belonged
to that tribe, Government was pleased to overlook the past, and again
to receive them into favour. In lieu of all right or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>title to collect black mail, compensation to the
amount of 1740 rupees per annum was settled upon them.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Of all the tribes of Booteahs inhabiting the
interior or most northern mountains, the Thebingeahs appear to be the
most easterly. About forty years ago a quarrel arose between them and
the Rooprae Booteahs of Char Dooar, regarding the right to collect
contributions or black mail from certain Bohoteahs, or slaves. Being
defeated, the Thebingeahs were for eleven years denied all access to
the plains by their unrelenting foes. Previous to this feud, the former
had the right to collect the whole of the Booteah dues from Majbat; but
after this, their black mail was appropriated by their opponents.</p>
<p class="par">Having, about twenty-nine years ago, partially made up
matters with their enemies, the Rooprae Booteahs, the Thebingeahs again
visited Assam, and have since that time made collections in Majbat in
conjunction with them. Formerly, as they aver, they were the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>channel through which the Char Dooar Booteahs
sent tribute to Towung. Before the quarrel, their route to Assam lay
through the Char Dooar Booteahs&rsquo; country; but since then it has
been abandoned, and they now enter by that of Kooreahparah Dooar. At
the present day their numbers are very small, and they appear to be a
peaceable, inoffensive race.</p>
<p class="par">The town of Tibbung is stated to be sixteen days&rsquo;
journey from the plains of Assam. For the first twelve days the route
lies through the country belonging to the Kooreahparah Booteahs. The
next march brings the Thebingeah Booteahs to their own frontier village
of Sangtie. The Thebingeahs are tributary to the Towung Rajah, who is
subordinate to the Deba and Dhurma Rajahs of Lassah. In speaking of
Lassah, they make the distance from their country much greater than
there is reason to believe it to be. They aver that in going to Lassah
they cross a great river (probably the Sampoo) which is the Lohit or
Burrampooter, that traverses the whole valley of Assam. Towung is said
to be twenty days&rsquo; journey from Tibbung, in a westerly direction.
From the little information we have hitherto been able to gather, it is
evident the Thebingeah Booteahs were once a powerful tribe; but feuds
and exterminating wars with other neighbouring <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>tribes have reduced them to an insignificant
state. The British Government generously bestows on this clan 141 rs.
13 ans. 6 pice per annum, in lieu of the black mail they formerly
extorted from the Ryots of the village of Majbat in Char Dooar.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">These tribes reside eastward of the Rooprae and
Sheergawn Booteahs, in the mountains north of Burgong, called the
Jumara Guyah hills, distant from Burgong, vi&acirc; the Dymarahhat or
market, about six difficult marches. The whole of the Akha tribe is
reported to consist of two hundred families; the Kuppah Choor Akhas, of
sixty or seventy families; and the Meeches (who are also, like the
Kuppah Choor Akhas, a tribe of Akhas residing far in the interior,
north of the whole) are estimated at three or four hundred families.
The whole are armed with bows and arrows, and long swords, but they
have no fire-arms of any kind. The Huzaree Khawa Akhas were formerly
the most formidable of the two clans, but through the energy and daring
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>Kuppah Choor Akha chief, Taggee, they have been
obliged to acknowledge him supreme. His will at the present day may be
said to be paramount; for though his contemporary chiefs profess to
look on him as their friend and equal they fear to incur his
resentment, and submit to his dictation with concealed feelings of
dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="par">Previous to the massacre of a detachment of the 1st
Assam Light Infantry at Baleeparah, the Huzaree Khawa Akhas had always
collected Pocha or black mail to the yearly amount of 175 rupees; but
after the above catastrophe they were looked on as outlaws, and were
denied all intercourse with the people of the plains. In February,
1844, however, the following chiefs of this tribe were summoned to
Tezpore, and an annual sum of 148 rupees was settled upon them; on the
condition of their abstaining from committing further depredations on
our subjects or joining with other disaffected tribes:&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">From all the information obtainable regarding this
tribe, they appear to have been always looked upon by their neighbours,
the Booteahs and Dufflahs, as a ferocious band of Dacoits or banditti,
living entirely upon plunder, and never scrupling to shed blood for the
successful prosecution of any unprovoked aggressions, whether on the
Booteahs, Dufflahs, or British subjects. In this light the late Mr.
David Scott, Agent to the Governor-General, on his first visit to the
Char Dooar, regarded this clan. Considering that they had no right or
title to collect pocha, or black mail, he verbally directed that they
should be treated as enemies, and not allowed to enter the British
territory: if they attempted it, the guards were to fire upon them.
This was absolutely necessary; as the Taggee Rajah, just prior to our
conquest of Assam, and during the Burmese government, had frequently
committed serious depredations on the people; and on one occasion he
ransacked several villages, and attacked the estate of Pond Borowa of
Char Dooar, who was barbarously murdered with twenty-five of his
followers. In 1829, the Taggee Rajah and his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>Kuppah Choor Akhas had a quarrel with the Akhas
of Somgsong Rajah. Many lives were lost in the prosecution of this
feud, and the Taggee Rajah was at last obliged to take refuge at
Burgong, in Char Dooar. Brijnath Hazaree had the courage instantly to
apprehend him at Gorahgong; and, putting him in irons, sent him down to
Mr. D. Scott, then at Gowahatty. Here he was incarcerated in the common
gaol for four years; at the expiration of which period (in
1832&ndash;33) Mr. Robertson, the then Agent to the Governor-General,
directed his release and allowed him to return to his native hills, in
the hope that this act of clemency would secure his future fidelity and
attachment to the British Government. But Mr. Robertson was deceived.
No sooner did this child of the forest and the mountain find himself
again at liberty, than, regardless of his engagements, he immediately
collected together a few of his old followers, and, by the mere
influence of his savage character, he soon rendered himself independent
of the Towung Rajah, and took tribute from the Rooprae and Sheergawn
Booteahs. He then resorted to his former lawless practices of rapine
and destruction; declaring that, now he was released from the Gowahatty
gaol, he would not rest until he had sacrificed every man who had aided
in apprehending <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208"
name="pb208">208</a>]</span>him. Such was the terror his name inspired,
that the slightest report of his approach alarmed the inhabitants of
the plains, and they deserted their villages in the utmost
consternation. It was well known that no quarter was given or mercy
shown by the freebooter: men, women, and children were indiscriminately
butchered; neither life nor property was respected; and safety was only
attainable by timely flight.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">At one time it was the practice in Assam to locate small
bodies of troops in stockades along the frontier, north and south of
the valley at the foot of the hills; or in the immediate vicinity of
hostile tribes, so as to overawe them and prevent predatory incursions
into our plains for the capture of slaves and plunder. These posts,
being far distant from the support of the head quarters of the
respective regiments, and away from the immediate control of European
officers, discipline and vigilance were perhaps too little regarded;
and the consequence was, that detachments were not unfrequently
surprised and massacred in the most savage manner. In 1835, there was a
stockade at Baleeparah in Char Dooar, garrisoned by one havildar, one
naick, and six sipahees of the 1st Assam Light Infantry. About 10
o&rsquo;clock <span class="sc">A.M.</span> of the 3rd of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>February of the same year, the Kuppah Choor and
Akha chiefs, Taggee, Nizam, and Somgsong, accompanied by a few daring
followers, proceeded to the stockade: the havildar, unsuspicious of any
treachery, went outside to converse with the Taggee Rajah, and told him
that he must not enter the stockade. After a short conversation the
Taggee Rajah&mdash;as a signal understood by the Akhas, drew his sword
and inflicted a wound on the havildar&rsquo;s left leg. Nazim Rajah
then cut down the Naick with his own hand, and the whole of the Akhas
instantly rushed on the havildar, entered the stockade, and murdered
every person they could seize; slaughtering in all sixteen persons: the
havildar, naick and four sipahees, and the wives and families of the
Goorkha sipahees. Two sipahees of the guard happened to be bathing in a
tank close by at the time of the attack, and saved their lives by
running into the jungles. After the massacre, the Taggee Rajah set fire
to all the houses inside the stockade, and retired with his followers
to the fastnesses in the neighbouring hills.</p>
<p class="par">Intelligence of this disaster reaching the civil
authorities, a proclamation was immediately issued, offering a reward
of five hundred rupees to any person who would bring the Taggee Rajah,
dead or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>alive, and two hundred rupees for any
information that would lead to his apprehension. This proclamation,
however, was in 1837&ndash;38 modified by the express order of the
Honourable Court of Directors, who intimated that the proceeding was
most exceptionable, and that rewards should only be given for the
apprehension of offenders, and not for slaying them. From that day
until 1842, the whole tribe of Akhas and Kuppah Choor Akhas were
treated as outlaws. Our outposts were strengthened, and all British
subjects prohibited from furnishing them with grain or any other
necessaries of life.</p>
<p class="par">In 1842, the Taggee Rajah, of his own free will, came
down from the hills and surrendered himself to the British Government.
The excuse pleaded by him for the massacre of the guard was the tyranny
and insolence of the sipahees towards his tribe; but it does not appear
that the sipahees had any quarrel with the Akhas or Kuppah Choor Akhas,
and it is therefore reasonable to conclude that the latter destroyed
the guard because they were posted there to prevent depredations on the
plains. Notwithstanding the crimes committed by the Taggee Rajah,
Government directed his release, on his swearing future allegiance on
his own behalf <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>and that of his tribe. This was a matter of
necessity: there were no means at hand of summarily punishing the
outrage that had been committed, and the influence of the Rajah was
requisite to curb the future irregularities of his people. As an
inducement to him to restrain a rapacious banditti from future
aggressions, a pension of twenty rupees per mensem was bestowed upon
him for life. The Taggee Rajah, it might have been supposed, returned
to his native hills somewhat appeased and gratified; but here again the
British authorities were erroneous in their calculations. Incapable of
comprehending our motives, and distrustful of our purposes, the Rajah,
for two years, never resorted to the station of Tezpore to receive his
pension. In 1844, however, an interview with himself and other chiefs
took place, and an amicable and satisfactory arrangement was made. The
Taggee Rajah received his pension of 240 rupees per annum granted in
1842; Nechoo received 24 rupees; Sankhandoo, 32 rupees; Seerkoolee, 32
rupees; Sorsoo, 32 rupees: in all five chiefs, their pensions amounting
to 360 rupees per annum.</p>
<p class="par">Thus terminated a desultory, harassing war of twenty
years with one of the most restless tribes on the frontier. The manner
in which the forbearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=
"#pb212" name="pb212">212</a>]</span>of these savages has been
purchased will, we are persuaded, not be misconstrued into fear or
weakness, but be productive of future peace and security and a freer
intercourse with the people of the plains.</p>

<p class="par first">The Dufflah tribes are divided into innumerable
petty clans, and reside in Char Dooar, Now Dooar, and Chuh Dooar. They
are a very uncivilized race of beings, and formerly were extremely
troublesome: committing atrocities, attacking and kidnapping the people
of the plains, and extorting a large amount of black mail in kind
annually. To enumerate the several petty robberies, disturbances, and
murders committed at different times by these wild mountaineers, would,
at the present day, be neither interesting nor profitable: it will
suffice to remark that the people are all disunited, living under
independent chiefs with separate interests, and have never leagued
together in large bodies to ravage the plains for plunder or the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=
"pb213">213</a>]</span>capture of slaves. No union seems to prevail
amongst them as with the Singphoos, Abors, and Khamtees; their
irruptions and depredations, therefore, are always on a small scale.
Almost every clan seems suspicious of its neighbour, and the sanguinary
feuds amongst themselves are frequent. Of their religion, manners,
customs, and habits, we regret to say little is known, and that little
of a character not to be relied on: the same may be said of our
information respecting the Akha tribes.</p>

<p class="par">In 1836&ndash;37, an agreement was entered into with the
Dufflahs to forego their extortions on receiving from the British
Government a fixed sum in lieu of all demands. Unlike the Booteahs, who
cannot live in the plains, the Dufflahs seem disposed to adopt
agricultural habits; and considerable numbers have deserted their hills
and located themselves in the plains, paying revenue for the land they
cultivate at the same rate as our Ryots. From these symptoms of
industry, we are led to hope that in the course of time others will
follow their example, and descend from their hills to enjoy the
protection of the British Government; when their condition will be
greatly ameliorated.</p>
<p class="par">In Char Dooar there are no less than one hundred and
eighty Dufflah chiefs, belonging to twelve distinct <span class=

lieu of the black mail formerly extorted from the Ryots. In the Now
Dooar, there are nine dooars (passes or tracts of country leading into
the northern hills) occupied by fifty-eight Dufflah chiefs, who receive
compensation or a pension from Government of 1,523 rupees 9 ans.
annually in lieu of black mail; making a grand total for both Dooars of
2,543 rupees 9 ans. 8 pice. It remains only to notice the amount
supposed to have been collected as black mail by the Dufflahs from the
people in Now Dooar previous to the year 1836&ndash;37, when a
pecuniary compensation was given to the Dufflahs in lieu of this
objectionable exaction. The contributions levied as black mail were
nearly all given in kind. On the arrival of the Dufflahs once a year,
from their mountains in the Now Dooar, it was their custom to take from
the Sahoorea Ryots Government free pykes (or men), from each
house:&mdash;</p>

considered as their slaves, from whom they claimed the right to collect
two-thirds of the produce of their labours. Each Bohoteah received from
the British Government two poorahs of land, and one rupee only was
taken from him as revenue, or capitation tax; being two rupees less
than that paid by the Government Pykes. The remission of two rupees
granted in his favour, was to enable him to meet the demands of the
Dufflahs against him, in addition to the following amount of black

<p class="par">From this it would appear that the Bohoteahs paid to the
Dufflahs five rupees each in produce; while the free population was
assessed at the rate of about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>eight rupees per village of
twenty houses, which would average about six annas four pice per house.
From the free and slave population united, as far as we have means for
determining, the sum realized in kind from the inhabitants of the whole
Dooar, amounted to 2,503 rs. 10 ans. 6 pice; so that in reality the
Dufflahs have gained by the money substituted for black mail.</p>
<p class="par">In the palmy days of the Ahoom Government it is not
certain that this system existed; but on the Ahoom Rajahs becoming
proselytes to the Hindoo creed, they and their followers degenerated;
and being unable to check by force of arms, the inroads of the numerous
hill tribes both on the north and south frontiers of the valley&mdash;a
space of 400 miles, accessible by innumerable passes&mdash;they readily
permitted the tribes to levy black mail once a year on certain portions
of land called Dooars. Thus were continual hostilities averted, and the
Ahoom Rajahs had leisure to pay attention to their own affairs.
Intestine commotion, however, worked the destruction which foreign
aggression was restrained from accomplishing. <span class=

unfriendly. Thus we understand the term Abor Nagas, Abor Dufflahs,

<p class="par adDescription">Being an Artist&rsquo;s impressions of
Countries and People at the Antipodes. By <span class="sc">George
French Angas</span>, Esq. In two vols. post 8vo., with numerous
Illustrations.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;These are two volumes of good artistical
description, with much of finer staple than the title-page promises.
Mr. Angas observed nature in the Southern hemisphere with a
painter&rsquo;s eye, and has thrown much poetical feeling into his
impressions of it.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;He has not the bias or coarseness of
many who have gone out to the antipodes; he has a better taste, in some
sense a more cultivated mind, and is lifted above the atmosphere of
Colonial partizanship.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Already favourably known to the public,
both as an artist and an author, Mr. Angas has fully confirmed every
expectancy by his new publication. Generally speaking, we might say it
was artistical and descriptive, picturesque and poetical, did we not
fear that these epithets might mislead the reader into an impression
that it was not at the same time <i>curious in actual observation and
faithful in details</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Angas has produced a very
interesting work, and illustrated it with sketches which do much credit
to his ability in his profession.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>The
Britannia.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;After a careful reading of these two
volumes, we pronounce them, without any hesitation, to afford on the
whole the most faithful pictures of savage life in Australia and New
Zealand yet published.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Weekly Chronicle.</i></p>

POETS,</p>
<p class="par">EXEMPLIFYING</p>
<p class="par adTitle">I. IMAGINATION AND FANCY.</p>
<p class="par adTitle">II. WIT AND HUMOUR.</p>
<p class="par adDescription">Each volume is complete in itself, and
preceded by an Essay illustrative of the qualities respectively
exemplified in the selections; the best passages are marked and
commented upon by Mr. <span class="sc">Leigh Hunt</span>, who also
characterizes each author. Bound in cloth, with gilt edges, price 10s.
6d. each.</p>
<p class="par"><i>Opinions of the Press, on</i> <span class="sc">Wit
and Humour</span>.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The design of this delightful series
extends beyond a collection of elegant extracts, while it combines the
best features of such collections. The two volumes already published
are precisely the books one would wish to carry for companionship on a
journey, or to have at hand when tired of work, or at a loss what to do
for want of it. They are selections of some of the best things some of
our best authors have said, accompanied with short but delicate
expositions and enforcements of their beauties. They are truly most
genial, agreeable, and social books.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is really a delightful volume,
forming a proper complement and companion to its predecessor on
&lsquo;Imagination and Fancy.&rsquo; Each of them gives us the best
passages of the best writers, in their respective kinds, illustrated by
one who will himself leave no mean remembrance to posterity, in the
spirit of genial criticism, informed by a delicate faculty of
discrimination. What more could literary epicures
desire?&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;If we were to choose the subject and the
author of a fireside book for the long winter evenings, we should
certainly call some such volume as this into existence. The reader will
look for exquisite things in this book, and he will find a great deal
more than he looks for in the prodigal resources opened up in its
pages. It is the very essence of the sunniest qualities from English
poets.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Atlas.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;There is something genial in the very
title of this volume; and it does not belie its title. &lsquo;Wit and
Humour,&rsquo; forms a pendant to &lsquo;Imagination and Fancy,&rsquo;
by the same author. A like design is embodied in both works. The book
is at once exhilarating and suggestive: it may charm frivolous minds
into wisdom, and austere ones into
mirth.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Athen&aelig;um.</i></p>

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;We are prepared emphatically to declare,
that this work is the most valuable contribution towards a proper view
of painting, its purpose and means, that has come within our
knowledge.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Foreign Quarterly Review.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;A work distinguished by an enlightened
style of criticism, new to English readers, and by the profound
observation of nature displayed by the author.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Dublin
University Magazine.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is the production of a highly
gifted mind, one who has evidently bestowed time and labour to obtain a
practical knowledge of the fine arts, and who writes eloquently,
feelingly, and fearlessly.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Polytechnic Review.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;It has seldom been our lot to take up a
work more admirably conceived and written than this beautiful and
elaborate essay. To a perfect idea of the scope of the inquiry, and a
mastery of all the technicalities required for its due treatment, the
Graduate unites considerable metaphysical power, extent of
philosophical and scientific knowledge, a clear and manly style of
expression, and no inconsiderable command of humour and
satire.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Atlas.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The Oxford Graduate is a bold
revolutionist in art.... A very Luther in art-criticism.... He has
asserted and established the claims of Landscape painting to a much
higher rank than it hitherto enjoyed.... The second volume of this
remarkable work rises above the first. Indeed, we question if any but a
high order of mind will embrace the full grandeur of its design, or
follow the masterly analysis by which its propositions are
elucidated.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>English Gentleman.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The author now comes forward with
additional force, and, we must hope, with still higher effect, on the
public taste.... He directs his attention in the present volume from
the individual artists to the art
itself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Britannia.</i></p>

<p class="par"><span class="sc">Volume I.</span>&mdash;Comprising</p>
<p class="par">THE MAURITIUS AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.</p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;The first volume of a work intended to
completely exhibit England&rsquo;s Colonial Empire. The author is Mr.
Pridham, who, in a modest preface, apologizes for having at so early an
age undertaken so gigantic a task. The first volume, however, shows no
lack of either ability, research, or knowledge. It is occupied with an
excellent account of the Mauritius, divided into four parts: the first
part gives its history from its discovery by the Portuguese to the
present time; the second describes its inhabitants, and their
institutions and states; the third its physical features and natural
productions; and the fourth its industry, commerce, and government.
Ample information is given on all these heads, and regarding the extent
of the author&rsquo;s design, and the evidence he gives of the
requisite qualification to carry it out satisfactorily, we make no
doubt that his work will be a valuable addition to the history and
geography of our colonial empire. The present volume is complete in
itself.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Britannia.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is the first volume of what
promises to be an important national work. The instalment now before us
is brimful of valuable and interesting information, making up by far
the most complete account of Mauritius which has yet been given to the
world. The author has the qualifications necessary to the due
fulfilment of the task which he has set himself. He is patient and
painstaking, accurate and impartial.<span class="corr" id="xd24e5820"

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is the first volume of a series,
which we hope to see completed in the spirit with which the task has
been undertaken. As a whole, we are bound to say that the book is a
standard one, and that &lsquo;England&rsquo;s Colonial Empire&rsquo;
has met with a chronicler of zeal, industry, and
ability.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Colonial Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;There is no other such description of
the Mauritius extant. The author has not only consulted the best, and

<p class="par adDescription">Or, <span class="sc">A Year among the

By <span class="sc">Andrew Steinmetz</span>. In one vol. post 8vo.

<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is a remarkable book&mdash;a
revealer of secrets, and full of materials for thought.... It is
written with every appearance of strict and honourable truthfulness. It
describes, with a welcome minuteness, the daily, nightly, hourly
occupations of the Jesuit Novitiates at Stonyhurst, their religious
exercises and manners, in private and together; and depicts, with
considerable acuteness and power, the conflicts of an intelligent,
susceptible, honest-purposed spirit, while passing through such a
process. If our readers should be disposed to possess themselves of
this volume, it will be their own fault if the reading of it be
profitless.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>British Quarterly Review.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is as singular a book of its kind
as has appeared since Blanco White&rsquo;s &lsquo;Letters of
Doblado,&rsquo; with the advantage of dealing with the Jesuits in
England instead of Popery in Spain. * * * It will be found a very
curious work.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;If it be desirable to know what is that
mode of training by which the Jesuit system prepares its novices for
their duties, this is the book to inform us, for it is a chronicle of
actual experience.... The work of Mr. Steinmetz is throughout marked by
great fairness, ... he neither conceals nor exaggerates: a spirit of
candour pervades the whole narrative.... Could we know the experience
of other novices, we should find that all have undergone, with more or
less of intensity, the process so vividly described in this volume....
It is written in an extremely animated style. The author&rsquo;s
thoughts are original, and the passages relating to his personal
history and feelings are agreeably introduced, and add to the interest
of his narrative. It is a sufficient proof of his accuracy that, though
the Jesuits have many pens in this country, not one has been hardy
enough to impugn a sentence of his
statements.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Britannia.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;Mr. Steinmetz writes a most singular and
interesting account of the Jesuit seminary, and his way of life
there.... He seems to be a perfectly honest and credible informer, and
his testimony may serve to enlighten many a young devotional aspirant
who is meditating &lsquo;submission&rsquo; to Rome, and the chain and
scourge systems. There is nothing in the least resembling invective in
the volume.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle<span class="corr" id=
"xd24e6068" title="Not in source">.</span></i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;At a time when Jesuitism seems to be
rising once more, any work on this subject comes very opportunely. How
the writer became a member of this mysterious body gives a key to the
character of the man himself and the spirit of his book.... This
narrative is well written, and as interesting as we
expected.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Weekly Chronicle.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;An unvarnished account of the
Jesuits&rsquo; College at Stonyhurst, its discipline and routine of
observances and customs,&mdash;of these we have the most minute
details, and the whole is a faithful picture of a remarkable condition
of life.... From this curious book you may form some idea of the
Jesuits and their course of proceeding.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary
Gazette.</i></p>
<p class="par adReview">&ldquo;This is a curious volume, of no little
interest and eloquence, written by a scholar and an
enthusiast.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Atlas.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There is internal evidence that this is a genuine
narrative, and a very singular one it is; full of very curious and
striking matter.... The &lsquo;Essay on the Constitutions, Confessional
Morality, and History of the Jesuits,&rsquo; will amply reward the task
of perusal.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The work has all the interest of a romance, and
yet we do not believe that any portion of it is fictitious.... The
author writes well, and evinces a strong and disciplined mind. The
picture he draws of Jesuitism is a fearful one. The reader will find
abundant matter for grave consideration in this most singular and
striking volume.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John Bull.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A more remarkable work it has seldom been our
fortune to peruse. We hear and read much of the Quietism and Passive
obedience inculcated amongst the Jesuit body; but here we become
personal spectators of these principles in action.... Mr. Steinmetz
appears to be a most remarkable character. He may be received as an
unbiassed witness.... We repeat it, Mr. Steinmetz&rsquo;s book is most
valuable; earnest and truthful in its tone, and extremely interesting
in its detail.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>New Quarterly Review.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The volume presents a true and valuable picture
of Jesuit education in England, and on that ground every Protestant
will find the volume worthy of an attentive
perusal.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>British Churchman.</i> <span class=

<p class="par">&ldquo;&lsquo;Tales of the Colonies&rsquo; is an able

his matter is solid and real.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;This is a <i>book</i>, as distinguished from one

<p class="par">&ldquo;The narration has a deep and exciting interest.
No mere romance, no mere fiction, however skilfully imagined or
powerfully executed, can surpass it. The work to which it bears the
nearest similitude is Robinson Crusoe, and it is scarcely, if at all
inferior to that extraordinary history.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>John

<p class="par">&ldquo;Since the time of Robinson Crusoe, literature has
produced nothing like these &lsquo;Tales of the

mixture of fact and fiction, yet it gives, we have every reason to
believe, a true picture of a settler&rsquo;s life in that country; and
is thickly interspersed with genuine and useful
information.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Chambers&rsquo;s Edinburgh

<p class="par">&ldquo;The contents of the first volume surpass in
interest many of the novels of Sir Walter

<p class="par">&ldquo;An exceedingly lively and interesting narrative,
which affords a more striking view of the habits of emigrant colonial
life than all the regular treatises, statistical returns, and even
exploratory tours which we have read.... It combines the fidelity of
truth with the spirit of a romance, and has altogether so much of De
Foe in its character and composition, that whilst we run we learn, and,
led along by the variety of the incidents, become real ideal settlers

in the settlements of Australia, with so much vigour and truth as Mr
Rowcroft. He rather seems to be a narrator of actual occurrences than
an inventor of imaginary ones. His characters, his manners, and his
scenes are all real. He has been compared to De Foe, and the comparison
is just.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Britannia.</i></p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;These volumes form a second series of
&lsquo;Tales of the Colonies,&rsquo; and the pages are marked by the
same vigorous and graphic pen which procured such celebrity for the

there is a freshness about these volumes which brings them out in
strong contrast to the vapid productions with which the press is
teeming.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;Messrs. Smith, Elder and Co., of Cornhill, have
just published the first volume of a New Edition of the Works of this
gentleman, which has the advantage of the latest revisions and
corrections of the author. The writings of James are so well known to
the readers of fiction, that it is unnecessary to call their attention
to them, or to say anything which previous criticism may have left
unsaid. The present edition is well got up, the type is clear, sharp,
and legible, and the size of the volume convenient for the reader, and
appropriate for the shelves of a bookcase. The book, as it is, will
form a pleasing addition to the collections of readers of modern
literature, of the class to which it

<p class="par">&ldquo;We are glad to see our prognostication respecting
the New Edition of Mr. James&rsquo;s Works, more than fulfilled by the
rapid absorption of a very large first edition, and a second in the

whose vraisemblance is always so perfect; and even what he invents so
like truth, that we can never fancy we are reading fiction: nor,
indeed, are we, in the historical portions of his
publications,&mdash;and these form the far greater
division,&mdash;which are all drawn from diligent research, deep study,
and elaborate comparison.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Literary Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="par">&ldquo;This is a most admirable edition of the Works of
this popular author, convenient in size, and handsome in appearance.
It, moreover, possesses the advantage of being revised and corrected by
the author,&mdash;no small recommendations, since, the generality of

of his productions increases their value, and renders them a source of

it is the publishers&rsquo; intention to continue the volumes until all

Elephant group, in which the authors say &lsquo;is most signally
displayed the numerical richness of forms which characterises the
Fossil Fauna of India;&rsquo; and the first chapter relates to the
Proboscidea&mdash;Elephant and Mastodon. The authors have not
restricted themselves to a description of the Sewalik Fossil forms, but
they propose to trace the affinities, and institute an arrangement of
all the well-determined species in the family. They give a brief
historical sketch of the leading opinions which have been entertained
by pal&aelig;ontologists respecting the relations of the Mastodon and
Elephant to each other, and of the successive steps in the discovery of
new forms which have led to the modifications of these opinions. They
state that the results to which they themselves have been conducted,
lead them to differ on certain points from the opinions most commonly
entertained at the present day, respecting the fossil species of
Elephant and Mastodon.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Address of the President of the

may with truth, that it is the best Topographical Guide to the

<p class="par">These articles, written by gentlemen long resident in

contain, in a condensed form, an immense mass of information relating
to the subjects of which they treat&mdash;information which has
hitherto been scattered over an extensive surface, and therefore,
beyond the reach of the majority of readers, whilst, at the same time,
a large body of original intelligence of the most authentic character
has been added to these various compendia of existing information. The
Review, which is the organ of no party, and no sect, and supported by
men of all shades of opinion, aims at the collection and production in
a popular form of all that is important in the history, the politics,
the topography, the statistics, the philology, the manners and customs,
the political and domestic economy, &amp;c. &amp;c., of the countries
and people of the East. The form of publication, and the general
design, is similar to that of the leading European reviews, excepting
that it is in no wise a party publication, and is devoted exclusively
to Oriental subjects.</p>

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (The digitized holdings of the Staatsbibliothek
zu Berlin are all interested parties worldwide free of
charge for non-commercial use available.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
